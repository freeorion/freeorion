    concede of other.



    Make it possible to hide the kraken nests from turn 1 and 2 (#4226)
    monster nests are supposed to have a chance to go hidden under cloud spawns
    this does not work correctly for krakens (because those nests can also be created in turns 1 and 2)
    discussion https://www.freeorion.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=114618#p114618
    this fixes this extending the possible turns and at the same time restricting to the turn after the nest was added

    Increase growth by 25% (#3621)
    Before introducing growth policy in 5c9b5023f00e047f1b33e260677a13f21d4f6c2b,
        base growth factor was 0.01
        Then it was 0.005, but one could improve it by 50% using the policy
     The new formula introduced in  6a9b32fec516bc2fa0a37f2d079e204948456a17 (#3703)
        divided growth by target population and had base growth factor 0.08
        i.e. it is the same as 0.005 for the previous formula, if the planet has a max population of 16
        for smaller planets it is faster and for bigger planets it is even slower.
     This commit increases base growth by 25% (this might be still a little bit low)

    make NewFleetOrder and FleetTransferOrder consider fleets with no set arrival starlane as arriving from their current systems. this should fix issues with merging fleets.



    Sneaky species have easy planetary stealth tech (#1620)
    * Laenfa are sneaky
    * All research cost for planet stealth is halved for sneaky species

    * micro-management safe by being cheaper than the steps (actually dont know, with the steps you get results earlier)
    * also added the capability to use %planettype% in sitreps (taking a planet ID or a stringtable key)

    Move survey_universe to empire module and call it earlier (#3762)
    * Move survey_universe to empire module and call it earlier
    * Removed second survey_universe_lock
    
    This should fix #3760 for good.
    It also makes sense as a refactoring, since survey_universe mostly sets values in the empire module and was completely independent from the rest of ColonisationAI.
    It does also set some value in the colonization module (nice mix of spelling ;-) which should probably be protected by locks as well, but this can be done with a later PR, this one is big enough and is needed as a fix.




    Improve AI invasion handling (#3754)
    This should fix the three points described in #3745. It should conquer more successfully and waste fewer troopers now.
    The AI still builds too many troopers (priority calculation sometimes produces strange results) and may ignore good planets (planetary rating also needs work), but these are for another PR.



    [AI] Ensure colony_buildes are initialized before usage (#3744)



    Fix reconnection attempts sometimes persisting throughout timeout.
    On expiry of m_deadline_timer, the m_reconnect_timer is canceled. However, if both timers expire in a short enough timeframe, the m_reconnect_timer callback may already have been scheduled and thus can no longer be canceled. To prevent this, let m_deadline_timer set a flag upon expiry and check that flag before attempting to reconnect.



    When loading SP game, assign AIs by name to respective empires (#3738)




    Fix timeout being sometimes ignored in ClientNetworking::Impl::ConnectToServer() (#3620)
    Previous to this patch, small timeout values are effectively ignored. This happens because boost::asio::io_context::run() is a blocking call and the attempt to async_connect() may time out after e.g. 2 seconds on my machine. This means any shorter timeout parameters will effectively be ignored and any longer timeout still only has a resolution of, e.g., 2 seconds.
    The fix here is to introduce an asynchronous timer which will cancel pending operations once timeout occurs.

    - quick fix: reducing probability for natives on roids and GGs by factor five

    - adding system special of derelict small troop ships crewed by khakturian, to be randomly stumbled upon players just like the other derelicts




    - fixing population dieoff effect for species Thenian and the according sitrep message
    - improved sitrep-message 'new dyson forest growing' with pedia link to dyson forest (for the noobs)
    - noted some todo's related to pedia with possible future improvements
    - fixed some fixme's - they work best when followed by a colon, this will highlight them similar to todo's in modern ide's
    - make list of homeworlds commaseparated in the pedia-homeworlds-page


    - streamlining the pedia text generating code a little by introducing versatile helper methods to replace some massively redundant code and prettify the player visible output at the same time, admittedly at the expense of a tiny little bit of extra computations every time the player clicks on a pedia link but that is negligible and not really noticeable



    - fluffing out sly description some more to account for stealthiness and possible other gaseous beings

    - the Thenian are not only well defended, but now have good planetary stealth too and can not colonize anyway



    - during universe creation, allow new native species to be placed who have no good habitat but only adequate or poor

    - adding species #4 the Celestephyte, to be continued ...
    - adding new native species #1 Nightsiders, #2 Sleepers and #3 Khakturian


    [AI] Consider researching space flux hulls if you dont research organics


    Add support for Python's asyncio

    It uses approach described in https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-eventloop.html#asyncio.loop.run_forever
    to call olny ready callbacks and then return back to application.


    [AI] Improve AI systems_connected performance (#3559)
    * Optimize AI systems_connected performance
    Instead of running a BFS for each pair of system ids, cache the set of systems connected to the capital in a single depth-first-search and check if queried system_ids are within that set. Since most of the visible systems will be connected to the capital, this will cover most cases. Only if both systems are not connected to the capital, we will have to run another BFS. However, the search space will be significantly smaller since -again- most systems will be connected to the capital and thus won't be part of the search.


    [AI] Fix star based colonization value calculation
    The larger boni should apply if the AI does not yet have a star of that type. The defect was introduced in #3484
    

    Allowed AI to delegate player
    Allows locally launched AI to skip authentication.
    Allows player or AI to delegate someone without lobby if they have single empire to play.
