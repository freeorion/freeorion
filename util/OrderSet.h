    An OrderSet is typically composed on the client with IssueOrder(order), and
    then sent to the server to be executed again. IssueOrder(order) immediately
    executes the order to change the client's backend state.  The second
    execution on the server changes the server game state. Orders only executed
    on the client do not change the server save game state.

    On game reload, reloaded orders need to be re-executed on the client because
    the client state start from the last saved server state. Orders are
    saved/serialized as unexecuted so that when they are loaded they can be
    mixed with newly issued orders and both the loaded and newly issued orders
    will only execute once.

    RescindOrder(order) will try Order::Undo() and if that succeeds remove the
    order from the set.  */
