## [v0.4.3] - 2013-10-26


### Key Changes

- Shields now reduce damage, and all new shield & armor content.
- Many fixes and improvements to the AI.
- Detailed combat log display.
- Numerous GUI tweaks and improvements.
- Galaxy Generation is now based on a editable random seed.
- New clouds and nebulae on empty systems and moving around the galaxy.


### Detailed Changelog


#### New Features / Improvements

- Fundamental change to ship shield mechanics: ship shields reduce the amount of
  damage suffered from a hit by a fixed value (determined by the shield strength
  stat), instead of providing additional structure that regenerates between
  battles.
- Reworked supply block / fleet movement blockade mechanics:
  - Supply blocks and fleet movement blockades have been harmonized to occur in
    the same situations.
  - Non-stationary ships no longer create blockades / supply-blocks.
  - Armed aggressive fleets arriving in a system and then remaining stationary
    will maintain any supply flow for their empire, and block it against enemies
    not already having armed aggressive fleets present.
  - If armed aggressive fleets for two enemy empires arrive at a system at the
    same time, supply maintenance takes precedence over supply blocks -- they
    will each maintain supply for for their empire, and not block supply for the
    other, for so long as both sides remain and survive.
  - An empire 'secures' use of a starlane as an exit from a system simply by
    having a fleet enter that system along that starlane.  If no armed
    aggressive enemies were already present in the system, then passage through
    all exiting starlanes is secured for that empire so long as it maintains an
    armed aggressive fleet presence in that system.
  - Passage of an empire's fleets through 'unsecured' starlanes exiting a
    blockaded system is blocked until the blockade is completely broken, by
    defeating all armed aggressive enemy forces present (previously movement was
    only halted for one game turn); exit along a 'secured' starlane will be
    allowed after the fleet has halted for at least one turn in the system, even
    if the blockade is not broken.
- Raised max number of systems to 5000 in GUI.
  - Note FreeOrion is balanced for and performs best with a galaxy in the low
    100s of systems.  Higher numbers make a game increasingly unbalanced and
    make rendering performance and turn processing times worse.
- Many fixes and improvements to the AI.
- Added a configurable random seed value for galaxy generation.
- Made focus visible on detected planets a player doesn't control.
- Detailed combat log display.
- New Moderator player type in multiplayer mode:
  - Sees the full universe like an observer.
  - Controls the length of turns.
  - Can create and destroy objects, add or remove starlanes, and set ownership
    of objects.
  - Can be used with no other human players and several AIs to have a
    more-controlled AI test arena than using observer mode.
- Made fields visible if any part of them is within detection range, rather than
  their centre.

  go directly to the index, regardless of what page the view is currently on.
- Replaced pedia panel button text with arrow icons.
- Tweaked multiplayer default empire names, species and colors selection.


#### Balancing

- Reduced required distance to moving ships for Collective Thought Network
  (from 500 to 200).
- Species balancing:
  - Having xenophobic species in an empire causes disruption (in form of
    maluses) for the colonies of the xenophobic species as well as for other
    colonies near them.
  - Xenophobic species get the Concentration Camp tech at the start of the game.
  - Reduced Etty detection range malus (from 20 to 9).

## [v0.4.1] - 2012-08-03


### New Features/Improvements

- Players can control zero population planets or 'outposts'.
- Reworked stealth and visibility system. Empires now have a detection rating,
  and ships/planets have a detection range. Within range, detection strength is
  determined by the empire's detection ability. Outside range, there is no
  detection.

    and Self-Sustaining.  Population in each flourishes for different reasons.
    More differences planned.
  - All Homeworlds now provide a population bonus, and for some species, can be
    set to 'Growth' to provide population bonuses for colonies of the same
    species.

- Added clearer fleet icons.
- Made AI empires choose more distinctive colors.
- Made structure meter icon distinct from health meter icon.
- Added icons for some ship parts.
- Added animated system selection indicators.
- Replaced ground invasion overlay graphic.


### GUI

- Sorted techs alphabetically in encyclopedia index.
- Added a separate message for starting up AIs so any problems with that won't
  appear to happen during universe generation.
- Hid unresearchable and unproducible items on the tech tree, production screen,
  and design screen.
- Made map zoom with the slider smoother.
- Removed separate fleet windows that opened when double-clicking a fleet in the
  main fleets window.
- Limited messages window history to 100 lines.
- Coloured fleet window icons with empires / monster colour.
- Tweaked tech dependency arc positions.
- Added tooltips to producible items in production screen list.

## [v0.3.17] - 2011-09-23


### New Features / Improvements

- Added space monsters.
- Added neutral natives on planets.
- Added frequecy of monsters and natives can be adjusted during galaxy setup.
- Ground troop ship parts that allow a ship to invade neutral or enemy planets.
  Planets can be invaded only if their shield meters are zero.  The original and
  new owners get sitreps after invasions succeed.
- Very basic ground combat system for capturing planets - ship combat can no
  longer capture planets.
- Reduced turn processing time, particularly for large galaxies.
- New versions will ignore old `config.xml` files, preventing some crashes after
  updating.
- Added more lists of content, and more details about content, in the
  encyclopedia.
- Reduced file save size by using binary format (instead of semi-readable text).


### Balancing

- Generally a lot of little tweaks to make the beginning of the game more
  playable.
- Decreased cost of colony pods by 20%.
- Unexplored systems block resource sharing between planets, preventing players
  from knowing about a hostile presense in a system before exploring it.
- Ships no longer have functional detection when moving on starlanes.  Ships
  must be in a system to detect objects.
- Planets can be seen, although without details, by any object in their system,
  regardless of detection and stealth.  Detection strength above planet stealth
  gives details about the planet.
- Planets do not increase their shield, troops, or defense meters on a turn they
  are attacked.
- Fleets must end a turn's movement if they arrive at a system that contains
  hostile fleets and no friendly fleets.
- Increased base detection of all hulls to at least 5.
- Colonies target construction is increased to 20 so once the meter fills, they
  create 1 jump supply lines.


### Content

- Added a lot of minor "native" species, a few of which have extended
  descriptions.
- Experimental addition of various space monsters.
  - Added domesticateable space monster nests.
- Added Small & Medium basic hulls (smaller and cheaper than standard).
  - Improved, usually cheaper, pre-made ship designs.
- Added Computronium Moon & Damaged Computronium Moon specials.
- Added automatic terraforming to Gaian planets.
- Added guard ships sometimes to Gaian, Ancient Ruins, & Computronium specials.


### Graphics/GUI

- Added binary star variant star graphics.
- Added new building graphics.
- Systems with no stars but with populated planets now show their system name on
  the map.
- Systems with only non-player populated planets have a lighter name on map than
  non-populated systems.
- New sitrep messages.
- Slightly improved resolution settings apply button functionality on OSX.
- Made default sidepanel with slightly larger so that the 6th meter icon in
  planet panels will not be partly hidden.
- Made default message window and players list wider and less tall.
- Invade button on planet panels works similarly to the Colonize button; a troop
  ship must be selected in the same system.


### Bugs

- Fixed issue where empty fleets would remain when moving ships around.
- Fixed crash when using conditions to check the distance between two systems.
- Made sidepanel disable focus droplists when the planet is not owned by the
  client's player.
- Modified the Imperial Palace to only work on planets owned by the empire that
  produced it, preventing captured palaces from moving a player's capital.
- Fixed bug with detection system where ships in a system could detect
  arbitrarily stealthy objects in the same system regardless of their detection
  strength.
- Fixed issue where planets would not feed themselves, even if they produced
  adequate food, while being blockaded.
- Fixed issue where ordering a single ships to colonize multiple planets in the
  same system could leave nonfunctional cancel buttons on planet panels.
- Fixed bug where actual system name was being shown instead of "Deep Space" in
  the FleetWnd.


## [v0.3.16] - 2011-06-15


Changes since the last release include:

- Replaced the fullscreen turn progress window that covered the map with
  progress indicator text in the message window.  The map now stays visible
  between turns, but with order-issuing UI disabled until the next turn starts
  being playable.
- Chat messages are now enetered in the same message window with a more obvious
  interface for entering text and displaying old messages.
- Added an empire / player list window above the chat / message window. When any
  empire or player is selected, chat messages are sent only to that player.
- The server now sends updates several times between turns, including fleet
  movements before combats, and a full update (as before) at the start of the
  next turn.
- Added an encyclopedia to the in-game interface, showing information about game
  content like ship parts, techs, species, etc.
- Added the option to have observer players in multiplayer games. These players
  can see the whole universe, but don't have an empire to control and can't
  control when turns are ended.
- Added the option to have AI players in multiplayer games.
- With the observer option and AI players in the multiplayer lobby, it is now
  possible to create an AI-only game with only a human observer.  This works
  like an AI test arena, with the AIs playing against eachother and no human
  player.
- Added a "Drop" option in the multiplayer lobby, to allow removing human or AI
  players from games.
- Added "Deep Space" to possible types of systems in universe. These systems
  have no star, but may still have a planet.
- Made map screen zoom centre on the cursor instead of the centre of the screen.
- Improved rendering support for graphics cards that don't support rendering
  buffers and shaders.
- Made system sidepanel resizable and draggable.
- Made the UI generally respond better to FreeOrion window resizing.  The intro
  screen generally looks good, but production and research don't resize
  properly, yet.
- Content updates, including new species.
- Tweaked fleet window layout to remove the new fleet drop panel when the window
  is very small.
- Added optional autogenerated effects descriptions to various tooltips and
  content descriptions. These must be enabled in the options to be seen, since
  many people complained that the autogenerated text was hard to read.
- Translated stringtable updates.
- Updated AI scripts.
- Reworked autoresolved combat.
- Added an "Apply" button on the resolution screen.  This seems to work on
  Windows, but may not on other operating systems.
- Changed the tech tree layout code to a custom implementation.  There may be
  some quirks with this new system.
- Tweaked layout and rendering of meter bars.
- Fixed issues with food distribution to planets.
- Made rollover link text colour modifiable in options.
- Made SidePanel retain scroll position of planets list between opening and
  closing the panel or changing system, and when pressing the turn button.
- Fixed issue with SidePanel where scrolling up planet panels would cause the
  system droplist and forward/backward buttons to become unusable.
- Fixed sidepanel scrolling problem when expanding and collapsing planet panels.
- Tweaked how colonization works, so that ships ordered to colonize, and their
  fleets, don't disappear until the turn is ended.  Ships ordered to colonize
  are marked with an indicator.  As well, colonization now can't occur if there
  are enemy armed ships in the same system.
- Various bug fixes and new features within the game content and AI scripting
  systems.
- Made the client respond more promptly to server disconnections, so that
  players don't attempt to finish their turn before being made aware of the
  disconnection.


## [v0.3.15] - 2010-08-04


Changes since the last release include:

- Added scriptable species definitions in species.txt. Species have names,
  icons, focus settings, evironmental preferences, food consumption and effects
  associated with them.  Many data-table based meter modifications have been
  moved into species effects, including population and health dependence on
  planet environment level for a species.
- Removed secondary focus setting, and removed the balanced focus option.
  Planets now have only a single focus selection, all of which much be specific
  and (hopefully) more interesting to play with and easier to create content
  for.
- Made focus settings moddable as part of Species defintions.  Available foci on
  a planet can depend on arbitrary conditions, which may make for interesting
  gameplay changes with advancing tech or situational changes during a game.
  Each species can have a distinct set of available foci as well.
- Fixed issue with custom ship designs that would frequently crash the game when
  they were built.
- Modified behaviour of design screen when modifying a design:  the incomplete
  design's info is now shown in the encyclopedia panel whenever the design is
  modified or if the main panel is clicks.  Clicking a part or hull once shows
  info about that part or hull, as before.  The information about ship designs
  in the encyclopedia is also greatly expanded.
- Added right-click popup menu command on the list of completed designs on the
  design screen: "Delete Design".  This lets players remove designs from the
  list that appears on the production screen, and from the completed designs
  list itself on the design screen.
- Added species property to planets and to ships, which is used when colonizing
  to determine the species of the new colony.  Built colony ships get the
  species of the planet where they were built.
- Added an indication of ships species next to the design name of a ship on the
  fleets window, and planets species in their population tooltip.
- Modified colonization UI to require a *single* colony ship to be selected
  before showing the colonize button for colonizable planets.  The colonize
  button now shows the initial (determined by the colony ship capacity) and
  target planet population (determined by the species to be colonizing) on the
  colonize button.
- Added some Python library files in a zip in the main FreeOrion directory in
  the Win32 installer.  This should fix issues with nonfunctional AI when Python
  hasn't been installed on a user's system.
- Removed the homeworld special, and modified species to track all the planets
  which are their homeworld, which are set during universe generation.  Multiple
  planets can be a homeworld for a species, which is helpful as there are
  presently only two species available.
- Fixed (hopefully) some issues with directories-finding code on Linux.
- Modified apperance of meter bars on the sidepanel, to support showing current
  value, change in current value, and target/max value, even if the target is
  less than the current value.
- Added a food consumption meter type, which is shown on the planet panels on
  the sidepanel, next to health and population.
- Planet population icons use their species icon, rather than a generic
  population icon.
- Added a droplist to pick species during single or multiplayer game setup.
- Replaced contents of `empire_names.txt` with various generic empire names,
  rather than the species names that were there, since species are now a
  separate concept from empires.
- Modified how empires and players information are stored in and retreived from
  save files, to make it easier to get this information when loading games
  without needing to load the whole save file.
- Made loading games much less likely to crash the client or server.  Any errors
  that occur will abort the load and (hopefully) show an error message, and
  likely return the player to the intro screen, rather than crash.
- Fixed issue with saving or attempting to write to an unwritable log file,
  which could previously crash the client or server.
- Added some logging of the time it takes to execute various initialization
  tasks, to help future performance tuing.
- Added an "inherent" meter cause type, for a few default/basic meter levels
  that are set automatically to make the game mechanics, particularly for
  stealth, work better.
- Reworked Meter concept.  Now meters have just a single value, instead of a
  current a max as before. Some meters have associated meters that are used like
  a max or target value, but not all, which is useful because various uses of
  meters don't need a max or a target value.
- Added new meter types for max and target meters, as these are now separate
  meters internally.
- Modified the population growth mechanics to account for food allocation meter
  values and the possibility of larger population than target population.
- Removed upper bounds on meter values. This may cause some UI problems if
  values are larger than can be shown in the available space, but we'll deal
  with this when it becomes a problem.
- Modified tooltips to handle new paired (or unpaired) meters.
- Changed clickable links in sitrep entries and encyclopedia entries to be
  always distinctly coloured rather than underlined when moused over.
- Modified effect parsing for new meter system, and accordingly updated content
  files.
- Moved various data table-based meter modifications into effects.
- Modified parts palette on the design screen to not show buttons for classes of
  parts for which none exist.
- Changed resource output calculation to use meter values, rather than a more
  complicated multiplication and scaling between meter value and planet
  population.  The resource output can still depend on population by making the
  effect that sets the resource meter value depend on population.  This makes
  understanding output and where it comes from simpler.
- Tweaked colour of industry meters.
- Added Dump functions to various gamestate objects, which can be used for
  debugging or logging.
- Added numerous content scripting object properies and modified existing ones,
  including adding a string property type, and properties such as object name,
  species, building type name, planet focus, ship design id, fleet id of a ship,
  planet id of a building, system id for any object, final and next and previous
  system id for ships, and the number of ships in a fleet.
- Added a SetSpecies effect and a Species condition.
- Changed Homeworld condition to use new system of species having one or more
  homeworld objects, rather than working with a special.  Homeworld condition
  can match any homeworld, or can take a list of species names whose homeworlds
  should be matched.
- Modified FocusType condition to take a list of focus type names to match.
  Planets with those foci will be matched.
- Modified BuildingType condition to takte a list of building type names.
- Fixed some issues with CMake build system.
- Wrapped some code in try-catch blocks to prevent some crashes when parsing
  stringtable entries.
- Fixed issue where empires would lose visibility of starved planets, and never
  actually observe them being stared, so would perpetually think they were in
  the state they were immediatly before starving.
- Disabled the message box that popped up to inform players they had won, as
  this was annoying, particularly when playing a game with no AIs, in which case
  a player would always win on the first or second turn.
- Replaced ship health meters with structure and max structure, as health meters
  were changed to health and target health, and it doesn't make sense to have
  more structure (-al integrity) than the max, even though a planet could have
  (temporarily) more health than its long term stable health value.
- Renamed some tooltip resource "production" strings to "output", to avoid
  confusion with the separate "production" concept in game.
- Consolidated some stringtable entries related to meter tooltips, which now use
  standard meter name stringtable entries.
- Modified victory sitreps by adding a text parameter that can be filled in with
  an entry in the stringtable by the client.
- Added VarText support (in stringtable entries) for building types, specials,
  ship hulls and parts.
- Fixed some meter value discrepancies between server and client.
- Changed conditions and effects evaluation to use the initial value of a meter
  on a given turn, so that meter values can be repeatedly recalculated and not
  accumulate as a result.
- Removed several resource output object properties from content scripting,
  since these are now redundant with the resource meter values.
- Added new hull design backgrounds.
- Removed unused ship icons.
- Fixed some app bundle isues on MacOSX
- Removed "previous" value from meters... which contained the value of the meter
  on the previous turn, as this wasn't being used anywhere.
- Tweaked behaviour of code that sets default rendering settings dependent on
  graphics card GL version support, which is intended to reduce the number of
  crashes on older rendering hardware.
- Tweaked behaviour of stealth threshold slider on galaxy map.
- Fixed crash when clicking between FleetWnd and other windows and the map
  surface.
- Added initial code to 3D combat system to support cached rendering of objects.
- Improved simultaneous server/client combat timestep updating.
- Fixed issue with server logging that was shutting down before all logging was
  complete.  This should make server log files more useful after crashes.
- Fixed a minor graphical glitch on the encyclpedia panel, where a border line
  wouldn't be rendered.
- Fixed issue with autogenerated condition / effect descriptions that treated a
  "Value" in a SetMeter effect as a property of the source object, rather than
  the target object that is should be.
- Various stringtable changes / updates, etc.


## [v0.3.14] - 2010-04-30


Changes since the last release include:

- Progress on the 3D interactive combat system. This can be tested during
  regular games by running `freeorion --test-3d-combat` or directly by running
  `freeorion --tech-demo`.  This is not yet meant to be playable, however.
- Transitioned to CMake from SCons build system (Visual Studio and XCode
  projects are also still available).
- Tweaked planet population growth dependence on health.
- Misc. content / effect fixes.
- Various rendering tweaks and configurable options.
- Made the expected locations of binary and data directories more flexible.
- Fixed issue where running `freeorion -h` would still start the program after
  outputting help text for command-line options.
- Added indicator to system resource summary to indicate when there is no import
  or export of a resource * Added location indicator to production queue items.
- Various AI script improvements.
- Fixed bug where planets weren't properly autoselected on production screen,
  preventing production items from being enqueued in certain situations.
- Fixed issue where fleet buttons were rendered over top of sitrep or sidepanel.
- Moved "Moving To Unknown System" or "Holding at System" text to fleet panels,
  rather than a separate text box below the fleets list on the fleets window.
- Changed resource meter growth to +1/turn from a much more complicated formula.
- Fixed issues with meter growth prediction.
- Made ships regenerate 0.1 fuel/turn when not moving.
- Fixed issue where previous effectsgroups's target set were being used for
  subsequent effectsgroups, leading to problems with techs or buildings acting
  on the wrong objects.
- Fixed issues with Number, NumberOf, WithinDistance, and Affiliation
  conditions.
- Fixed issues with SetTechAvailability effect.
- Added minimum population requirements, below which population of planets is
  set to 0, to prevent very small numbers being tracked.
- Made buildings on a planet become owned by empires that colonize the planet.
- Added missing TradeStockpile property for effect definitions.
- Tweaked part tooltips on the design screen.
- Expanded part encyclopedia entry text.
- Added or fixed CreateBuilding and CreateShip effects and parsing.
- Allowed full effectsgroup definitions to be added to ship parts and hulls,
  rather than just stat-setting effects.
- Fixed issue with UI number rendering showing wrong numbers of digits.
- Made systems with resource sharing connections provide fleet supply.
- Completely reworked the visibility system to take into account stealth,
  detection and distance, and to have empire remember previously-seen but
  not-currently-visible objects and include these in displayed systems in GUI.
- Added fog-of-war indicator on systems and planets that aren't currently
  visible to player, but which the player previously had visibility of.
- Fixed issue with unreadable text on research queue.
- Added Stationary condition, that matches non-moving objects (for effects
  definitions).
- Added right-click popup command to split fleets.
- Added the ability to right-click command buildings or ships to be scrapped or
  cancel scrapping.  Ordered-scrapped ships aren't included in fleet fuel and
  speed calculations.  Ordered scrapped ships and buildings have a large red X
  over their icons.
- Added an optional coloured disc around objects to show their visibility
  radius, and an additional optional slider to set the "assumed stealth level"
  that is deducted from visibility ring radius, to show how far away objects of
  the indicated stealth could be seen by ships, planets or buildngs.
- Added a check for OpenGL version and automatic setting of some rendering
  options at first startup to hopefully prevent some crashes on systems without
  OpenGL 2.0 support.
- Made default mouse mode non-exclusive on Win32, to avoid issues with
  disappearing mouse pointer.
- Reworked planet panel rendering.
- Changed UI default colour scheme.
- Fixed issue with sidepanel scrollbar not showing up when needed.
- Stored empire name and server address be remembered from game to game.
- Disabled deleting of old autosaves when loading a save, to aide debugging.
- Added safety / sanity checks to order execution to prevent AIs from crashing
  the game.
- Removed MSVC 2005 project files.
- Made resource distribution and fleet supply use known systems, rather than
  only currently-visible systems.

  destroyed.
- Fixed fleet window layout issues.
- Fixed issue with inconsistency between expanded or collapsed panels on
  sidepanel in or out of production mode.
- Fixed crash where dragging a fleet onto the ships list would crash.
- Various translation updates.
- Fixed some issues with old gamestate flashing on the screen briefly when
  loading another game, or with old galaxy map appearing over the intro screen
  after resigning or being disconnected.
- Fixed issue where meter accounting estimates were wrong when loading games.
- Hid autogenerated effect / condition descriptions by default, since many
  people were complaining about how hard they were to understand.  Showing
  nothing is probably better in most cases, but they can be turned back on if
  desired.
- Fixed starvation sitrep generation.
- Fixed code that determine the directory where the running binary is located on
  various operating systems.
- Reworked automatic combat resolution so that combats can occur over several
  turns, and ships and planets can be damaged (see ship health indicator and
  planet construction dropping).
- Added a planet captured sitrep message.
- Disabled system name multi-empire colouring due to issue it was causing when
  interacting with underlining or bolding of system names to indicate presence
  of a shipyard or homeworld.
- Added option to specify player's name in single player.
- Fixed missing close X on FleetWnd.
- Fixed issue with "byte order mark" in stringtable files.
- Improved credits scroll rendering.
- Added an optional zoom slider to the map.
- Added utility variable "Value" to set meter effects, to allow modifying the
  existing value that's being set without needing cumbersome variables like
  `Target.MaxFarming`.
- Separated full screen and windowed resolution options.
- Made clicking on a tech on the queue show that tech in the encyclopedia.
- Made players joining multiplayer lobbies for new games be assigned different
  colours from any other players in the lobby, and be assigned empire name equal
  to their player names.
- Added meters to ships to store / determine their part stat values (range, ROF,
  damage), and effects to modify these meters.
- Added backup stringtable lookup in the English table. This means that missing
  strings in translated stringtables will be shown as English text, rather than
  an error message in game.
- Tweaked layout of multiplayer lobby screen.
- Added `--load` and `--auto-advance-first-turn` console commands to load a
  single player save with the specified name and to autmatically advance the
  turn once, which are useful for debugging.
- Fixed issue with SitRep being stuck under other windows on the map screen.
- Fixed issue where button text on intro screen would overflow available space.
- Fixed up FreeOrion icon file to have multiple resolutions, and to be used for
  the Win32 window and executable file.
- Fixed some issues with Win32 installer and uninstaller.


## [v0.3.13] - 2009-05-24

Changes since the last release include:

- Various incremental improvements to the combat tech demo, some visible
  (asteroids) and some not.
- New fleet icons that indicate the type and size of a fleet and point in the
  direction of travel when not at a system, with various options to control how
  they are displayed.
- Different arrangement of fleet icons around systems.
- Scanline-like fog of war indicators over system icons, which can be disabled
  in options.
- Reorganized UI colour options to make more sense and remove redundancies.
- Added circles around systems that have known starlanes connected to them.
- Fixed bug with irregular galaxy star placement.
- Significant AI script improvements: AIs explore, research, build ships,
  colonize and are aware of fuel range limits.
- Added a map distance scale indicator, with option to turn off.
- Changed positioning of fleet icons moving between systems to be squished
  (slightly) into the space between system rings, so there is always a
  ship-icon-free space around the star / within the system ring.
- Added scripting support for defining various properties about ship parts and
  hulls in text files, including variou statistics about ship weapons.
- Added indicators on map to show which fleet icon(s) contain(s) the selected
  fleet(s) in the active fleets window.
- Added indicators along fleets' move lines to show the positions they will be
  on future turns, up to their final destination ETA.
- Changed fleet move lines to use scrolling dots rather than stippled lines.
- Made ships passing through a system that can supply fuel at any point during
  a turn get refueled, rather than the previous requirement of starting a turn
  in a system to get refueled, and using up 1 unit of fuel to depart a system
  that has fuel supply.
- Fixed some issues with meter estimates when loading saves.
- Fixed issues with various lists in game not automatically repopulating
  themselves when something about their contents changed.
- Shrunk the size of asteroid "planet" panels on sidepanel
- Made system and planet names have italics, underlines and bold to indicate
  homeworlds, shipyards and capitols, respectively.
- Fixed some effect description parsing issues.
- Made the Imperial Palace building set the empire's capitol.
- Made techs cost nontrivial RP and turns, since many people objected to the
  1 RP and 1 turn development costs that were present.
- Added switches in a few source files to make techs, buildings and ships quick
  and cheap to build or research, without needing to make changes to their
  definition text fields.
- Updates to Russian, German, Polish, French translations.
- New Finnish translation.
- Made the fleets window resizable and changed the information displayed on ship
  and fleet panels and in the fleet window itself.
- Added tooltips to meter statistic icons on fleet panels in fleets window
- Added parsing code and text files to define or list the techs, ship designs
  and fleets that empires are given at the start of a new game.
- Added a new Optical Scanner ship part
- Moved some config files around to a directory determined at run time, so that
  nothing is expected to be in the working directory, making things work better
  on Linux in particular.
- Made colony ship colonist capacity / new colony population depend on the
  capacity of the colonization ship parts in the ship design.
- Added backgrounds behind ship parts on design screen to indicate the types of
  slots those parts can be placed in, and added matching slot graphics to
  indicate what parts can be put in them.
- Made planet panel selection work anywhere on the planet panel when the
  production screen is open.
- Fixed planet autoselection when the production screen is open, hopefully
  eliminating confusing cases where no planet was selected and people couldn't
  figure out how to build something.
- Made the selected planet and other selectable planets much more obvious on the
  production screen, by making it brightly outlines, and making unselectable
  planets have a gray background.
- Added a new Orbital Drydock building that's needed to produce some ship hulls.
  The homeworld starts with one, but building more requires some research.
  Adding this building means that colony ships can be built at the homeworld at
  the start of the game, which was previously not possible, leading to confusion
  for new players.
- Improved network connectivity on Win32 systems.
- Updated fonts, allowing more non-latin characters such as Ð¶
- Added Mac XCode project files to SVN.
- Fixed problem where the sidepanel wouldn't return to the state it was prior to
  ending a turn or opening and closing the research, production or design
  screens.
- Added a right-click popup menu to the options screen colour selectors, that
  lets one revert a colour to its default value.
- Increased the health on adequate and good planets, so that adequate planets
  actually grow before health research is done. This lets some AI colonies grow
  that were previously stuck at their initial population.
- Added some error output to console if config.xml writing fails, hopefully to
  help figure out some issues with Russian and Greek language Win32 systems that
  are getting "Invalid UTF-8" crashes.


## [v0.3.11] - 2009-01-09

- Fixed effect accounting, seen on tooltips for meter icons for planets on the
  sidepanel, so that newly-created buildings take effect immediately.
- Gave ships in fleet window fuel indicators.
- Fixed new colony starvation bug.
- Added tooltips to part icons on design screen.
- Various translation stringtables were updated.
- Added a MoveTo effect that can be used in techs or buildings to move ships,
  whole fleets, planets or buildings around the galaxy map.
- Star graphic updates.
- Fixed route-length calculations for moving fleets.
- Fixed bug where not enough systems were generated to fit the requested number
  of AI players. Now extra systems are generated when appropriate.
- New and modified tech icons.
- Fixed incorrectly drawn fleet move lines that occured in some situations.
- Added initial, limited, implementaiton of coloured starlanes along which
  empires can exchange resources. Lanes are coloured half-way to the next system
  if the starting system could propagate resources further, but is being blocked
  by a blockade or the next system being unexplored.
- Modified food and minerals distribution and stockpiling to be limited by which
  systems are connected and able to share resources.
- Added a few options on the UI tab for the galaxy map. Can now disable
  background stars and galaxy gas rendering, can disable optimized system
  rendering, and can turn turn on or off resource-sharing and fleet-supply lane
  colouring.  Can also adjust the size of lane colouring.
- Made it possible to refer to other stringtable entries in strings.
  `[[STRING_NAME]]` will be replaced with the string with the appropriate other
  string inside another stringtable entry.
- Highlighted the buttons at the top right of the map screen to indicate which
  of the various sub-screens are open (Research, SitRep, Menu, Design and
  Production).
- UTF-8 stringtable text endcoding was added, allowing non-latin text
  (eg. cyrillic) to be rendered.  Some glitches in this remain, however.
- Removed log4cpp dependency.
- Various other minor bug fixes and tweaks.


## [v0.3.10] -  2008-01-25


This is an unstable development update, with various new features, but also
various bugs.  Changes since the last release include:

- Toggles to turn off galaxy gas rendering and optimized star rendering that
  might cause problems for people with older video cards.
- Various art additions, including ship parts.
- Updated AI scripts.
- Removed the very verbose usage / command line output when outdated config.xml
  is present, and allowed the game to keep running in this case, just ignoring
  any invalid entries in the file.
- Various Design screen UI improvements.
- Improved default layout on the tech screen.
- Various tech / content additions. You now need a shipyard to build ships, and
  start with one in your home system.
- New panel of military-related indicators on the sidepanel, for things like
  shields and fleet supply range.
- Ship hulls and parts can now be given effects, and some have had some added to
  do things like give ships more fuel capacity.
- Tweaked how meter estimates are recalculated after focus changes, hopefully to
  improve some reported horrendously long delays after changing focus in
  long/big games.  Feedback on this would be appreciated.
- Various translation updates.
- A selector on the galaxy setup screen now allows one to select how many AIs
  are in new single player games.
- Added a preliminary list view to the tech screen.
- Ships now require and consume fuel while moving, and get it replenished when
  not moving in a fleet-supplied system, which are indicated by the scrolling
  dashed lines emanating from systems. Fleets now have a fuel indicator on their
  panels in the fleets window.  (Some of the aforementioned bugs are related to
  fleet movement as a consequence of this).
- Various other bug fixes (and additions).


## v0.3.9 - ???


Changes since the last release include:

- A mostly-statically-linked Linux binary is provided that should work on many
  distributions.
- Various new and updated art (tech icons, nebulae, map stars, etc.).
- Gassy substance on the map to give galaxies shape.
- Internal details of ship designs, hulls and parts and their interaction with
  other game features, including how they're defined in text files.
- Completely reworked design screen.  The current version is much closer to the
  planned design, though is still incomplete.  It can be used to design ships by
  drag-dropping parts after selecting hulls, and to review existing ship
  designs.
- New ship parts.
- Various Python AI interface improvements.
- Various minor UI improvements.
- Various bug fixes.
- OpenGL 1.5 is now semi-required on Linux.  The program might run without it,
  but this is unsupported.  Note that future versions will require GL 2.0 for
  Windows and Linux.


## [v0.3.8] - ???


If you're confused about version numbers, pretend the last few "RC" releases
didn't have the RC.  Release naming should be more consistent in future.

This is mostly a bugfix release;  the crash when an AI empire was defeated issue
in particular should be fixed.  Additionally, the capacity to do Python AI
scripting has been significantly increased, should anyone else be interested in
working on that.


## [v0.3.1-RC7] - ???


Some new stuff includes:

- Many new icons. Yay for art people.
- The infamous food bug is fixed! (and various other bugs).
- A new initial test ship design screen. You can pick a hull and add parts to
  it, and the ship will be buildable on the production screen.  Naming your
  design doesn't work properly due to map keyboard accelerators not being
  disabled on the design screen, though.
- An initial test fleet supply distribution route calculation and display
  system.  There are small checkered lines emanating from systems with planets
  you control over top of starlanes.  These can be expanded by researching the
  Fleet Logistics tech.  Enemy fleets block the propagation.
- Various UI improvements.


## [v0.3.1-RC6] - ???


The full list of changes is too lengthy to list completely, but some of the
notables include:

- FMOD is gone!  OpenAL is now used for sound, eliminating a non-free
  dependency.
- Several other dependency versions have changed (though this isn't visible to
  most players).
- AI runs on Python.  Anyone can edit the script in /default/AI/FreeOrionAI.py
  without needing to recompile FreeOrion.  If interest in this is expressed, I
  can write up documentation about the interface FO provides for AI, so contact
  me if you'd like that information.
- The production and research screens have been overhauled.  The UI is much more
  customizable now, with movable and resizable windows and more flexible
  displays of the tree view or the buildable items.  As well, queues have icons
  for their items on them.
- The sidepanel is significantly changed, with entirely reworked resource,
  population and buildings panels.
- Building panels on the sidepanel show in-progress and completed buildings.
- Specials on a planet are shown below the rotating planet render.
- There are tooltips on the sidepanel, in various stages of (in-)completeness,
  particularly on the resource panel, that provide lots of hopefully-useful
  information about what's going on to produce the numbers that are displayed.
  This should help make understanding how the game works much easier.
- Meter and resource production estimates on the sidepanel now account for
  effects much more accurately.  There are still some issues with this to be
  resolved, but results are shown graphically.
- Much art has been added, including new tech and special icons.
- Various bugs have been fixedâ€¦


## [v0.3.1-RC5] - ???


RC5 has been released.  It represents a lot of behind-the-scenes work, and some
more user-noticable stuff too.

**Note**: The save file format has completely changed, and so your old files
will not work.

- A few more techs, buildings, and graphics associated with techs and buildings
  have been added.
- It should be a lot faster to load and save games, and to receive new turns
  from the server. (This is the behind-the-scenes stuff.)
- There is now an indicator that shows up over a system when the cursor is over
  it, and another indicator over the currently-selected system, if there is one.
- The options window was completely rewritten. It should be more complete now,
  and should work a little better.
- There are now two modes of running FreeOrion available in the start menu --
  full-screen and windowed.
- Numerous bug fixes.
