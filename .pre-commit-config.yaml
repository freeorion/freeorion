    # We have multiple places where Python code is located
    # The main 3 points are:
    # - AI (default/python)
    # - Game rules (default/scripting)
    # - Scripting tests (test-scripting)
    # Each of them has own flake8 config
    # Other files shares the same config as AI
    # To addres this structure we run flake8 3 times with different set of excludes
