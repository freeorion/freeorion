/**
@page content_tags Content Definition Tags

@brief Content entries may have tags associated with them to help filter them
for later effects.

Tags are used to easily filter for entries, without relying on the specific
entries names.\n
These filters are applied in various areas, such as:
@li displaying only certain parts in the design window
@li not showing buildings unless other criteria are met
@li only affecting certain ships within a system.

For usage of this alias, see
@subpage content_tags_alias "content tags alias"
