# How to contribute to FreeOrion

As an open source project FreeOrion both relies on contributions from long time
developers and one time contributors.  This guide should help you to create
contributions that can be easily integrated into the FreeOrion project.


## I found an error in the game or I want to file a bug report

So you stumbled on a reproducible error in FreeOrion?  You can report it in
[FreeOrion Issues].  Please check before reporting the error if
someone else has already posted it.  When creating a new issue you will see a
template of required data.  Please fill in the template with all the information
that you know.

After reporting the error a developer will take over the report and maybe ask
you for further guidance and feedback, so please stay responsive.


## I want to contribute code

We gladly accept any useful addition to the project.  However before you start
developing something please inform the developers about your endeavours to avoid
duplicate work.  If you're trying to fix a reported bug please state that you're
working on the bug.  If you want to implement a new feature get in touch with
the developers via the [FreeOrion Forum] to check if the feature complies with
our idea of the game.

To start contributing first clone [FreeOrion Git] repository.  After that create
a branch with a concise name, if the branch implements an issue call it
`fix-<Issue Number>`.  To publish your contribution create a [Pull Request] and
wait for feedback from the developers.

To ensure your PR won't be rejected please make sure that:

* The code changes match the [Code Standards].  For Python code we follow
  [PEP 8].
* The commits of the PR are atomic.  This means that one commit should only
  contain a single logical and indivisible change.  If you need to describe the
  change inside the commit with a list or any other enumeration you're already
  doing it wrong.  Don't lump together functional changes and code style
  changes.  When style changes are needed put them into a separate commit.
* The [Commit Messages] follow the rules for a great Git commit message.
* The PR **IS** concise on the topic it addresses.  If you want to address
  different topics create different branches and PRs for them.  If the
  topics/PRs relate to each other document so in the PR message.
* The PR **DOES NOT** contain any merge commits from any other branch.  If you
  want to update your branch to a more recent master use the `git rebase`
  command.
