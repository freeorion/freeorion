Building FreeOrion
==================


Hardware and OS Requirements
----------------------------

FreeOrion will compile on Windows 7 (or later), Mac OS X 10.10 (or later) and
Linux operating systems. Other operating systems have reported to work, but
support is not actively maintained by the FreeOrion developers. FreeOrion is
developed for x86 compatible processor architectures, other architectures
haven't been tested.

The FreeOrion source code makes heavy use of templates and requires much memory
to compile ; 6 GiB RAM or more is recommended. To build FreeOrion, expect up to
45 minutes on a Intel Core i5 system.


Required Software Dependencies
------------------------------

FreeOrion depends on the following software to build:

  * [Visual Studio] - 2017 or 2019 for Windows Desktop ; Windows only
  * [Xcode] - 9.4 or later ; Mac OS X only
  * [CMake] - 3.4 (Mac OS X) ; 3.1 or later (Other non-Windows)
  * A C++17 compliant compiler - Other Operating Systems
    * [GNU GCC] - 8.0 or later
    * [Clang] - 5 or later
  * [Python] - 3.5.* or later
  * [Git]

FreeOrion depends on the following libraries or APIs to run:

  * OpenGL - 2.1 or later ; usually provided by the graphic card driver or
    Operating System
  * OpenAL - It's recommended to use the [OpenAL Soft] implementation
  * [Boost] - 1.58 or later
  * [zlib]
  * [libpython] - 3.5.* or later
  * [FreeType2]
  * [libpng]
  * [libogg]
  * [libvorbis]
  * [SDL2]


Obtaining FreeOrion Source Code and Software Dependencies
---------------------------------------------------------

For Windows and Mac OS X a [Software Development Kit] is provided as download to
compile FreeOrion from source. It contains the preconfigured and -compiled build
and runtime dependencies for the Visual Studio v141 toolchain on Windows and
Mac OS X 10.9 SDK with Xcode 6.4 or later on Mac OS X.

For Linux or other Operating Systems the build and runtime dependencies should
be installed by the preferred way for the respective OS (e.g. via Package
manager or compiling from source).

Step by step procedure:

 * On Windows:
   * Download the [FreeOrionSDK v11] from the FreeOrionSDK respository releases.
 * On Mac OS X:
   * The [FreeOrionSDK v11] is downloaded automatically when CMake creates the
     build environment.
 * Linux and other Operating Systems:
   * Install build and runtime dependencies by the preferred way for the
     respective OS.
 * Create a project directory `freeorion-project`.
 * On Windows:
   * Unzip the SDK archive contents into the project directory.
   * Execute the `bootstrap.bat` within the project directory. This will clone
     the FreeOrion repository and place the dependencies at the correct place.
   * If you want to create an out-of-source build using CMake, you should run 
     `git clone https://github.com/freeorion/freeorion.git FreeOrion` in the 
     `freeorion-project` directory, instead of running `bootstrap.bat`.
 * On Max OS X, Linux and other Operating Systems:
   * Navigate into the project directory.
   * Clone the project via Git:
     ```
     git clone https://github.com/freeorion/freeorion.git
     ```

This will leave you with the latest development branch `master` and the
FreeOrion source code in:

 * `freeorion-project/FreeOrion/` on Windows.
 * `freeorion-project/freeorion/` on Mac OS X, Linux and other Operating
   Systems.

This directory will be referred to as _source directory_ in the rest of the
document.

To build a specific release check out the desired version via `git checkout`:

```
git checkout vxxx
```

Where `vxxx` indicates the desired version.  A list of all available version
can be listet by invoking `git tag -l`, where releases are indicated by a
leading `v` followed by the release version number.


Compiling FreeOrion
-------------------

FreeOrion uses CMake as build system on most platforms. On Windows a manually
maintained Visual Studio Project is used for building.


### Windows (Visual Studio)

To build FreeOrion open the `FreeOrion.sln` project solution within
`_source directory_\msvc2017` or `_source directory_\msvc2019` with
Visual Studio.  Now compile the whole project by selecting the
`Build` -> `Build Solution` menu entry.

After the build finished successfully the binaries can be found within
the `freeorion-project/FreeOrion` directory.

I

### Windows (CMake; work in progress)

Create a `build` directory inside the _source_directory_ and change into
this directory. It will contain all compile FreeOrion build artifacs.

Execute cmake to generate a Visual Studio solution:

```
cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 15 2017"
```

After successfully creating the Makefiles build the whole project by
calling:

```
MSBuild.exe -p:Configuration=Release FreeOrion.sln
```

In case you want to utilize multiple CPU cores by running parallel
compile jobs, you can add the `-m` option to the command.

Alternatively, you can build FreeOrion by opening the `FreeOrion.sln`
project solution with Visual Studio.  Now compile the whole project
by selecting the `Build` -> `Build Solution` menu entry.
This will leave you with a build of FreeOrion executables.

After the build finished successfully the binaries can be found within
the `freeorion-project/Freeorion/build/Release` directory.

To run the executable without creating the symbolic link, you can first
change the directory to `freeorion-project/Freeorion`, then run
`./build/Release/FreeOrion.exe`.


### Mac OS X

Create a `build` directory aside the _source_directory_ and change into
this directory. It will contain all compile FreeOrion build artifacs.

Execute `cmake` to generate a Xcode project file:

```bash
cmake -G Xcode ../freeorion
```

After successfully creating the Project file, open `FreeOrion.xcodeproj`
with Xcode. Now compile the whole project by selecting the `ALL_BUILD`
scheme and pressing 'Command' + 'B'.

After the build finished successfully the binaries can be found within
the `freeorion-project/build/Release` directory.


### Linux and other Operating Systems

Create a `build` directory aside the _source_directory_ and change into
this directory. It will contain all compile FreeOrion build artifacs.

Execute `cmake` to generate Makefiles:

```bash
cmake ../freeorion
```

After successfully creating the Makefiles build the whole project by
calling:

```bash
make
```

In case you want to utilize multiple CPU cores by running parallel
compile jobs check out the the [make jobs](`--jobs`) parameter of
`make`.

After the build finished successfully the binaries can be found within
the `freeorion-project/build` directory.

### Android

Install Android NDK.

Build [Python-For-Android].

Build [Boost-For-Android] with iconv support for boost_locale library

```bash
./build-android.sh --with-iconv --arch=arm64-v8a --with-python=`readlink -f ../python-install` --layout=system $ANDROID_NDK
```

Ensure you got `libboost_python<version>.a` and `libboost_locale.a` libraries.

Create a `build` directory aside the _source_directory_ and change into
this directory. It will contain all compile FreeOrion build artifacs.

```bash
<android>/cmake/3.10.2.4988404/bin/cmake -DANDROID_ABI=armeabi-v7a -DANDROID_PLATFORM=21 -DANDROID_NDK=<android>/ndk-bundle/ -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=<android>/ndk-bundle/build/cmake/android.toolchain.cmake -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=-std=c++14 -DANDROID_ALLOW_UNDEFINED_SYMBOLS=Off -DBUILD_SERVER=OFF -DBUILD_AI=OFF -DBUILD_CLIENT_GG=OFF -DBoost_INCLUDE_DIR=<Boost-for-Android>/build/out/armeabi-v7a/include/ -DBoost_USE_STATIC_LIBS=On -DBoost_LIBRARY_DIR=<Boost-for-Android>/build/out/armeabi-v7a/lib/ -DBUILD_CLIENT_GODOT=On -DICUI18N_LIBRARY=<Boost-for-Android>/libiconv-libicu-android/armeabi-v7a/lib/libicui18n.a -DICUUC_LIBRARY=<Boost-for-Android>/libiconv-libicu-android/armeabi-v7a/lib/libicuuc.a -DICUDATA_LIBRARY=<Boost-for-Android>/libiconv-libicu-android/armeabi-v7a/lib/libicudata.a -DICONV_LIBRARY=<Boost-for-Android>/libiconv-libicu-android/armeabi-v7a/lib/libiconv.so ../freeorion
```

After successfully creating the Makefiles build the whole project by
calling:

```bash
<android>/cmake/3.10.2.4988404/bin/cmake --build . -- -j2 VERBOSE=1
```

After the build finished successfully the godot libraries can be found within
the `freeorion-project/build` directory and copied to `godot/client/bin/`.

Call `strip` on those libraries to clean debug symbols.

Export [Godot-Export-Android] with additional `default/*` resources.

To get logs run:

```bash
adb exec-out run-as org.godotengine.freeoriongodotclient cat files/freeorion-godot.log
