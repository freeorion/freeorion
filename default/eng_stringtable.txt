FREEORION_VISION
FreeOrion, an open-source game based on Master of Orion, is a turn-based game of epic space strategy that builds on the classic '4X' model by incorporating the nation-building elements of games such as Europa Universalis 2 and a versatile tactical combat engine. While its modular, open-source design allows for a significant degree of customization of the game engine and the story elements by the community, the FreeOrion team is dedicated to the construction of a living, breathing universe in a 'grand campaign' model.

Biology:
Adult Fifty-Seven are between 10 and 20 m long. The main deviation from the tapering serpentine body are the two resonating domes on the forward dorsal side. Various fins provide fine control. Entirely blind, they rely on smell, hearing, an exquisitely honed pressure sensitivity, and when the need arises bursts of echolocation. Fifty-Seven are omnivores: eating flocks of small flying creatures with the same relish as the floating phytoplankton. Since they remain aloft their entire lives and have no manipulator limbs, the Fifty-Seven have no material technology.

Personality:
The Fifty-Seven show little interest in the rest of the galaxy, or indeed in the parts of their planet that they don't use. The bulk of their attention individually, and culturally is focused on math. They do seem eager for new mathematical puzzles, so if research problems can be phrased properly...

Homeworld:
High g swamp world with a very dense atmosphere.

Reason for Staying:
The Fifty-Seven are in constant contact with most of the rest of their species, participating in a complex fractal 'song' that may also be a way to test complex mathematical hypotheses and/or some sort of social or artistic expression. Leaving the fractal song is apparently extremely unattractive.

The Raaagh are 1.5 meter tall stripe-furred bipeds.  The body is held leaning forward at 45 degrees, leaving the fanged jaws, and clawed arms free to fight, build or capture prey. Triangular ears and slit pupils give a cat-like appearance.  The tiny young hatch from a clutch of a dozen eggs at once. Little care or attention is paid to the young at this stage-- they must survive on their own competing against their siblings for hiding places and stealing food like vermin.  After three years usually only one is left, and the surviving young begin to learn to speak.  This suddenly activates parental instincts, and the survivor is carefully raised as a member of the Pride.

Personality:
Extreme territoriality is the Raaagh's most distinctive trait- woven throughout their daily lives and culture.  Related to that is a preference for the familiar and known. Curiosity is minimal, which probably explains their stone age technology.

Homeworld:
The Raaagh homeworld is of the Terran type.  Sea and land are more or less evenly spread out, with the largest continent coverly only 4% of planet's surface.  The many small continents and large islands encourage a territorial attitude.

Reason for Staying:
There's not bit of land big enough for an individual Raaagh to live on that hasn't been fought over for centuries.  The genetic compulsion of a Raaagh is to guard his territory with his life, and when possible to expand into adjacent land.  Abandoning one's territory is inconcievable, and a Raaagh forcibly removed from his territory goes violently insane.

The Hidden Gardener is a massive distributed fungal intelligence lying just beneath the surface. Each individual covers many square kilometers. Its actions and thoughts are slow. Various sensory nodes are scattered about by which it can monitor the weather and the growth of its garden. A Hidden Gardener, by means of enzymes, the encapsulation and releases of seeds, and the control of water, tends its garden to produce precisely the rotting plant matter it needs to survive.

Fungal-type life-forms seldom have much use for brains of any type, but the Gardener's unusual, and thoughtful approach to providing itself with food provides enough additional energy to make it work.

Their terran homeworld is an eerily park-like place with plants arranged with unnatural precision, but no other signs of habitation.

The wide ranging, delicate fungi-nets are too large and integrated into the soil to be moved off-planet, and since the Hidden Gardeners reproduce by 'splitting' into two consciousnesses when a Gardener grows too wide-ranging to have a decent thought-latency, there are no small, young individuals to take off planet.'''

Description
An Acirem is a 10-30 m ellipsoidal energy beings with large (30-100m) ''wings''. As they age they tend to accumulate material from around them developing a dusty and eventually rocky appearance (still maintaining the visible energy flows through their body and the gaps). Most Acirema live in a universe where the physical constants are slightly different, and there is only one place where they can get through to our universe, on their "Homeworld" of Portal. However, upon doing that they immediately begin to 'age' differently than in their own universe. Acirema cannot survive more than a few fractions of a galactic cycle in this universe. So an Acirem rarely spends much time before crossing back into their own universe.

As the Acirema found the anomaly that allowed them to enter into this universe, they also found that harnessing the differences in structure allowed them to generate energy in massive amounts in both universes. They also found that their bodies could release and manipulate massive amounts of energy. They rapidly began gathering material on Portal to study, and use to build structures on Portal itself. However that massive amount of energy meant they rapidly mined Portal out, and soon had very limited minerals that were safe for them to extract.

The massive amount of energy they can release as individuals and across the connection from Portal to their home universe, gives them the ability to produce large amounts of Industry, and also allows them to act as weapons. This makes Portal a very dangerous world to approach, as the Acirema are very wary of outsiders, and are sensitive to the vulnerability of their position. Trade with another universe is definitely beneficial, especially since they cannot obtain minerals from other planets. The Acirema on Portal seem to have a government that is similar to a military and/or research outpost (tightly controlled core with a majority loosely controlled) They are very secretive of the nature of their society back home.

"Homeworld"
Portal is a Radiated world close to an unusually bright Blue Giant Star, with a connection to another universe. It is thought that Precursor testing may have opened the connection, and caused the star to change. There is suspicion that there may have been intelligent life on Portal, and they were destroyed by the Acirema when the connection opened (either due to research or advanced weapons use).

Reason for staying
They can't stay here long enough to actually move to another planet and still survive.'''

Biology:
A giant serpentine swimmer, an Ourbools most distinctive feature is the massive bow curving away on either side of their head.  This houses the gravi-sensory organs.  Three tentacles hanging in front of the mouth allow Ourbools to manipulate their environment.  Ourbools mate only once in their life, and devote the next 35 years to caring for the school of 5 to 7 young -- generally assisted by relatives.  Ourbools live long so

Personality:
Ourbools are inclined to a nomadic life, hunting or herding their prey ichtioids.  Society focuses to a large degree on the proper and graceful interaction between two wandering groups that meet by chance.
A significant minority drop out of society and adopt sedentary lives bound by the practical requirements of their craft

Homeworld:
The homeworld, Oolur is orbited by 23 moons.

Reason for Staying:
The Ourbools find their sense of position via the regular movements of the 23 moons.  Everything is perceived against that gravitational background.  To be removed from that context is extremely disorienting to the point of "blinding" the unlucky traveler.  He no longer has the familiar to calibrate against so all he can perceive is meaningless graviton noise.

Description:
The Volp-Puglush-Vuu are an asexual species approximately 300 meters in length that live in tunnels on their homeworld. They subsist on silicates and have a vast number of short arm/mouth parts on the front of their thick cylindrical bodies that they use for manipulation/tunnelling/eating and for sending messages through their tunnel network. In early historical times there were several different strains of Volp-Puglush-Vuu but they were in constant conflict. Groups that successfully organized themselves were the best competers for resources, and as they moved from industrial to information age, one strain became dominant, and the remainder died out. The remaining strain began to optimize their homeworld for most efficient use of resources. They became incredibly adept at recognizing resouce needs, as well as how societal structures affected individual behavior.
The Volp-Puglush-Vuu society almost acts as a single organism, because society has been adapted to run so smoothly. However, this has led to a critical loss of independent function. While Volp-Puglush-Vuu society is incredibly efficient, it would take individual Volp-Puglush-Vuus hundreds, if not thousands of years to be able to successfully develop a new independent society.
They are very effective at directing merchant fleets, and make excellent bureaucrats for creating changes in societies. While they have an incredibly efficient war machine, and are capable of indivudually taking on various large battle engines, the chaos of combat is not their most effective environment.

Home World:
Hive is a large Barren world that is ~2 times bigger than its mass and material would suggest as all of it but a small metal core has been converted through tunneling and building into the Vast tunnel network of the Volp-Puglush-Vuu bureaucracy.

Reason for Staying:
Volp-Puglush-Vuu are now to integrated and ingrown. They now totally lack the independance and innovation needed to leave Hive and start a new colony.

# Theory Tech Names & Descriptions #
####################################

THEORY_SHORT_DESC
Theoretical Prerequisite

LRN_PHYS_BRAIN
The Physical Brain

LRN_PHYS_BRAIN_DESC
The structures and their functions in the brain are determined. The electrochemical and quantum nature of thought and memory are exposed. With understanding, alteration and augmentation of brain functions becomes possible, and new ideas are spawned at the frontiers of thought, its expression, and its replacement.

LRN_ALGO_ELEGANCE
Algorithmic Elegance

LRN_ALGO_ELEGANCE_DESC
With greater and greater difficulty of data analysis problems, traditional measures of algorithm performance become less useful due to the limitations of irreducible complexity. At this stage, other measures of algorithm form and function become significant; aesthetically and metaphorically, the elegance of the solution must be optimized.

LRN_TRANSLING_THT
Translinguistics

LRN_TRANSLING_THT_DESC
Lesser minds struggle with, or accept the confines of the language they have learned. Adequate minds reach and feel constrained by the concepts they are given ways to express. Truly great minds break free of the bounds of language, forming and analyzing thoughts that verge on the transcendental. But merely great minds are left isolated and futile, for without language to express thoughts, how can they share their insights?

LRN_PSIONICS
Psionics

LRN_PSIONICS_DESC
Through deep introspection or artificial enhancement, the brain may develop abilities to directly interact with the universe around it, bypassing the limitations of a physical body. Powers such as telepathy, empathy, clairvoyance, prescience, psychokinesis and psychoenergetics replace or surpass mundane biological or technological alternatives. Applications of these powers, including mind control, personality alteration and possession have profound implications for the relationship between talented and untalented beings.

LRN_ARTIF_MINDS
Artificial Minds

LRN_ARTIF_MINDS_DESC
'''Increases target research on all planets by 5.

By automatically inputting all data discovered by active researchers into a single automatic data processing network, data can be analyzed and new data obtained by an entirely automated research facility. Each planet can contain such structures regardless of the population's occupations, giving a bonus to research on all worlds.

While traditional computers have nearly unfathomable intelligence and computational abilities, they lack the essential qualities of self-awareness, consciousness or sentience. With the development of true artificial minds, these qualities may be synthesized, modified and altered. These investigations open new avenues of research into cognitive sciences and novel metaparadigms.'''

LRN_XENOARCH
Xenoarchaeology

XENOARCH_SHORT_DESC
Allows discoveries from Ruins

LRN_XENOARCH_DESC
'''Allows discoveries from Ancient Ruins.

The contemporary empires, races and single-star civilizations are not the first or only beings to have lived in this galaxy. Remains, ruins and rumours of the ancients may be found on deserted planets and lifeless asteroids, or drifting in open space. Finding and deciphering such clues holds great potential to reveal secrets, teach lessons, or give warnings of ancient knowledge.

It is often exceedingly difficult and dangerous to decipher the clues left by ancient civilizations in the form of highly advanced technology. Mistreatment of the technology or accidental activation can cause the technology itself and/or the archaeologists extracting the technology to be lost. By containing the technology safely within a force field and probing its depths via non-local field manipulation, it is possible to safely recover and unlock the mysteries of ancient technology.'''

LRN_GRAVITONICS
Gravitonics

LRN_GRAVITONICS_DESC
Analogous to the "color charge" of quantum chromodynamics, there are several types of graviton. With the common attractive-force graviton, the colloquial "anti-graviton", "right-graviton" and "left-graviton" may be combined to bend and flex the surface of space-time arbitrarily. This manipulation is perceived as control of the force of gravity, permitting structures, craft and investigations previously impossible, even theoretically.

LRN_EVERYTHING
Theory of Everything

LRN_EVERYTHING_DESC
Early, naive theories describe subsets of the four fundamental forces of nature: electromagnetism, the strong and weak nuclear forces, and gravity. A complete framework expressing all forces as special cases of a single interaction represents a holy grail of science. This theory describes the earliest moments of the universe, the most distorted depths of a singularity, the tightest windings of hidden dimensions and the final fate of the cosmos. Yet still, there may "exist" layers of existence beyond what can be observed and described by science...

LRN_FORCE_FIELD
Force-Field Harmonics

LRN_FORCE_FIELD_DESC
Like Fourier analysis of sound, electromagnetism, strong and weak forces may be expressed as harmonic quantum standing-wave superpositions of force-carrier particles. By selectively amplifying these harmonics, forces may be arbitrarily controlled to shield, attack, contain or support.

LRN_MIND_VOID
Mind of the Void

LRN_MIND_VOID_DESC
We are not alone in the cosmos... but why should the search be so limited? Many cultures have myths, legends or fervent belief in a higher consciousness. Whether a loving or malevolent God, or a detached observer, it is clear that something, perhaps the universe itself on some level, is alive, aware, watching.

LRN_TIME_MECH
Temporal Mechanics

LRN_TIME_MECH_DESC
What are "now", "future" and "past"? The twin paradox of special relativity, or the theoretical "wormhole" in its place, suggest early forms of "time travel". Direct manipulation of spacetime and temporal flux permit these effects to be harnessed and magnified. Temporal incursions cannot perceptibly alter the past of the universe that we perceive. They can, however, compress ages or extend moments to arbitrary durations, to uses limited only by the material supplies provided, and our own patience...

LRN_NDIM_SUBSPACE
N-Dimensional Subspace

LRN_NDIM_SUBSPACE_DESC
Early superstring theorists spoke of 10, 11 or 26 dimensional universes, with all but the 4 macrodimensions "curled up" so tightly as to be unseen. These and other dimensions may now be uncurled and opened, and the very surface of space itself stretched and pierced by shifting matter to or from levels of existence previously hidden below the surface of our limited perception, or creating layers or bubbles where none existed before.

LRN_UNIF_CONC
Unified Consciousness

LRN_UNIF_CONC_DESC
'''By transferring the mind into cyberspace, thousands of minds can act as one, their actions perfectly unified and directed towards the good of the whole.

Telepathic communication between individuals or mind-machine interfaces only permit the most basic, trivial and surface exchanges of thought and ideas. Truly joined minds function as a single consciousness, with the summed faculties and knowledge of its constituent parts, and acting as a new unique entity. This has great potential, but also significant risk, in that the union may not seek its own destruction, which is necessary for the original minds to be regained. Alternatively, one of the minds may dominate the other, controlling or destroying the other, rather than forming an equal, harmonious union.'''

Most complex organisms progress through various physiological stages during a lifetime, whether distinctly separated by metamorphoses, or blurred by continuous slow aging. In many cases, one or more of these stages are, at least at a given time, more useful and desirable than others. By delicate control of hormonal or mental mechanisms, it becomes possible to drastically speed or slow each stage, permitting fully developed and functional individuals to be produced in a fraction of the natural timeframe, and for those individuals to remain functional indefinitely, becoming effectively immortal.

By designing nanorobots capable of identifying and penetrating such pathogens, it would be possible to destroy them by completely deconstructing their genetic material.

While genetic alteration can repair or undo the effects of harmful or undesired mutations or correct biochemical imbalances, treating major physical trauma and non-genetic congenital defects requires actual physical corrective measures. Nanotechnology may be used to accomplish these tasks, with two important advantages: Correction may be done without invasive surgeries and associated secondary damage and risks, and treatment reaction time is greatly reduced, as the tools to do the job are always in place and ready to function.'''

GRO_ECO_METAMORPH
Ecological Metamorphosis

GRO_ECO_METAMORPH_DESC
Often, it is helpful to think of an ecosystem as a gigantic organism in and of itself, with predator-prey relationships acting as negative feedback loops, with newly introduced species acting as symbiotes or parasites, with populations acting as systems and individuals acting as cells. In this sense, every planet is alive, and as such, goes through various phases of "life". By manipulating these phases as one would in a biological organism, it would be possible to affect a planets environment with comparative ease and efficiency.

These adverse effects can include anything from weather patterns to the planet's size. Through xenological hybridization, a genetically adapted form of the colonizing species can be developed with the advantageous traits of the native fauna, thus allowing more of the planet to be inhabited.

Regardless of how well understood, or how adeptly improved, a biological system is limited by its inherent nature.

The lower atmospheric layers and core materials of gaseous planets contain even more exotic materials, in greater concentrations. Accessing these regions to extract the materials is difficult and treacherous, but eminently rewarding, compared to traditional surface mining activities.

Useful minerals are created throughout the volume of a planet, under various exacting chemical and thermodynamic conditions, including aqueous surface sedimentation, crushing core differentiation and mid-depth metamorphosis.

PRO_NANOTECH_PROD
Nanotech Production

PRO_NANOTECH_PROD_DESC
Traditional production techniques are fundamentally limited by the size and form of the tools they employ. As a product takes form, its outer layers may prevent direct access and manipulation of the inner structure, requiring inconvenient and inefficient adjustment to the order of assembly. Furthermore, the components of a larger product must be carefully formed and assembled to exacting specifications to ensure they will function as intended when combined. By using nanotechnology to form a complete product in one step, directly from the stock materials, these limitations can be bypassed, dramatically improving efficiency and production speed.

Methods which take advantage of the high density atmosphere and belt-zone circulation allow a significant amount of energy to be easily accrued and transported for use in nearby planets.

Low orbit of planetary bodies provides numerous benefits for power generation compared to planetary surfaces. Direct exposure to nearby solar radiation without atmospheric attenuation, and the orders of magnitude larger structures that may be assembled in microgravity to collect it are significant advantages. The resulting power may be used in orbit, or may be beamed to the planet to support surface industry.

Traditional means of production are limited by the necessity of self-sufficiency due to transportation and other logistical problems. Later developments in planetary regional cooperation permit some degree of specialization and co-operation, with each facility producing only a few parts or subsystems, and the whole system benefitting from concentrated expertise and economy of scale. Expanding this concept several orders of magnitude, it may adapted to a galactic scale, with individual planets or entire systems functioning in the role of the single specialized facility. The logistical difficulties inherent in this paradigm are also similar to those of the earlier iteration, and are scaled up to the same degree as the potential benefits.

''' Unlocks Hyperspatial Dam

Once the greatest fear of N-dimensional physicists, now the noblest goal. To deliberately create a hyperspatial rift between our universe and the next, but inside a dimensional bubble, safely separate from known space-time. Once this is accomplished, it would be a relatively simple matter to tap into the enormous flow of energy that would travel across the rift.

The geometry of physical space has always been a major impediment to the assembly of objects within that space. Objects cannot be collocated, and volumes cannot be simultaneously enclosed and open if their existence is restricted to a mere three dimensions. Moving beyond this limitation, parts of objects can be folded out of the way in a pocket dimensions, and contiguous lines may be passed around other masses by going "off-axis". Similar mechanisms are also used to assemble lower-dimensional objects in configurations that would be impossible without higher-dimensional pathways.'''

PRO_SINGULAR_GEN
Singularity Generation

PRO_SINGULAR_GEN_DESC
'''Harnessing energy from a black hole is significantly more dangerous than harnessing energy from a regular star, but also has potential for significantly greater gains. By building a generator designed to tap into the energy of particle-antiparticle collisions on the event horizon of a singularity, tremendous benefits to industry may be obtained.

As matter is drawn towards a singularity by the intense space-time curvature, or gravitational field, the matter forms an accretion disk and is greatly compressed and heated. High energy radiation emitted from the disk may be captured and harnessed for power generation. The event horizon of the singularity itself also emits radiation due to the annihilation of virtual particle-antiparticle pairs that form in its vicinity. This method of power generation is significantly more delicate and unstable than the accretion disk method, but can produce an even greater output.'''

'''At appropriate scales and under specific conditions, matter-energy becomes a unified phenomenon. Applied at larger scales, complete control over the structure of matter and the dynamics of energy becomes possible, as does the interchange between the two. Transmutation and replication, at limited scales, become possible.  However, despite the enormous rest mass energy equivalence of matter, converting directly to energy for bulk power generation is generally less effective than comparatively simple fusion generation.

Previous production techniques were essentially ways to avoid or remove particularly vexing problems with manipulation of matter. None of these techniques fundamentally changed the basic method however, which was to assemble larger objects out of supplied materials, be they prefabricated subsections, or raw minerals. By converting pure energy directly into the desired material object, the need for supplied materials such as minerals or food can become greatly reduced in times of necessity.'''

PRO_ZERO_GEN
Zero-Point Generation

PRO_ZERO_GEN_DESC
Any power generation mechanism that involves a material fuel supply is limited by the relativistic mass-energy relationship: no more energy can be produced than equivalent mass consumed, even with perfect efficiency. By tapping the inherent energy of the vacuum, or zero-point energy, an effectively infinite source is made available. The rate, or power, of this extraction is also theoretically unbounded, with limits only in the available means to collect and use the output.

CON_INFRA_ECOL_DESC
The basic infrastructure of an established planetary colony may seem to be created entirely by the colonizers, and to function only according to their designs. In reality, however, the ecology of the planet on which it is built is the foundation and support mechanism for the added infrastructure, and often forms an integral part of its function. Understanding the interaction between natural and artificial components, and the limits of the resources an ecological system can provide are essential to the development of an optimal and sustainable infrastructure for any colony.

They may also naturally self-regulate their internal environments, or potentially adapt to varied or changing surroundings as necessary, during or after their initial growth.

A shutter functions as both a solid wall and open window, according to the desire of its user. A room may be refurnished to serve an entirely new purpose, within the limits of the space available. This concept may also be extended to the actual form and structure of an entire building or city, whether mechanical or organic. Eliminating the need for demolition and rebuilding permits much greater infrastructure flexibility and efficiency. Single or isolated structures may also serve many purposes simultaneously, that would previously have required much larger and elaborate fixed designs.'''

CON_METRO_INFRA_DESC
When the entire surface of a world is covered, continued development must occur above and below pre-existing construction.  Care must be taken to ensure the stability of the undercut or overshadowed structures are not damaged, and transportation and supply routes must be rethought to support vastly increased population densities. Furthermore, novel stylistic and functional issues must be considered, to ensure that the newer levels, and the combined whole, are worth inhabiting.

CON_ARCH_MONOFILS
Architectural Monofilaments

CON_ARCH_MONOFILS_DESC
Essentially unbreakable and merely a few atoms in diameter, single-crystal filaments have many uses in improving traditional structure designs in durability and economy of construction. The capacity to suspend or stress other materials in previously impossible configurations also permits a wholly new designs. Low weight and high strength filaments are of particular use in large-scale orbital or surface to orbit spanning structures, where variations in gravity across lengths were previously very prohibitive.

CON_ASYMP_MATS
Asymptotic Materials

CON_ASYMP_MATS_DESC
Once certain thresholds of performance are passed, measuring the physical properties of materials for relative comparison becomes impractical in any terms other than orders of magnitude or logarithmic scales. Much like superconductivity in electronics, the tensile strength, toughness, density, elasticity, refractory index and other mechanical properties of materials may be controlled with effectively no limits. With all previously significant limitations removed, structure designs are further unhindered, and may extend or change by similar order of magnitude scales.

CON_CONTGRAV_ARCH_DESC
'''Increases the max resource supply range of all colonies by 1.

By installing a massive null gravity generator at a planet's core, it becomes possible to turn a planet's gravity on or off like a light switch, but in a narrow well. The planet's industry then gains all the benefits of low-G and zero-G, but without the drawbacks. Reverse gravity wells can also be created, making space launches cost practically nothing.

By fully controlling the orientation and strength of gravitational forces acting upon and existent within a structure, designs may simultaneously exhibit the freedom of weightlessness and the utility of having a defined up and down. The structure itself, and the local environments it seeks to provide, may take any shape in space, extending to great lengths, looping about itself, and making arbitrary interconnections. Simultaneously, local environments within may be infused with a useful tug, which may vary from or be entirely different from immediately adjacent areas.

When roughly the mass of a small moon or larger, it is no longer sufficient to conceive of what is wrought as a "structure", "station" or "ship". Rather, beyond this scale, the object becomes more like a heavenly body; its gravitational pull influences orbital motions, it may retain an thin atmosphere on its surface, and it may be orbited by, rather than orbiting with, lesser structures.

SHP_MAX_DISRUPT_DESC
The ideas of engineering and construction are very different in the environment of space. Different structural forms are utilized, and the basic architectural principals are drastically affected by the lack of gravity. By applying these ideas to the development of weaponry, it is possible to create weapons which are highly effective against microgravity architecture.

SHP_TACT_COUNTER
Tactical Countermeasures

SHP_TACT_COUNTER_DESC
Due to the unfamiliarity of space combat, not all tactical events and possibilities have been thought out and their consequences analyzed. As such, there may be certain tactics against which a tactically underdeveloped empire would have very little defense. Theoretical countermeasures to these tactics motivate the development of more advanced defensive systems and special devices.

SHP_TACT_SUPER
Tactical Superiority

SHP_TACT_SUPER_DESC
Many tactical scenarios are a complex form of Rock-Paper-Scissors; a defender may find himself vulnerable to attack because he prepared for a different sort of assault than that with which he was faced. Likewise, an attacker may have received incorrect or inaccurate information about an opponents defenses and find that his method of attack is ineffective. By developing an ideal fighting force for nearly all scenarios, the risk of loss due to unforeseen circumstances can be greatly reduced.

SHP_SURGICAL_DESTRUCT
Surgical Destruction

SHP_SURGICAL_DESTRUCT_DESC
Often, there are highly valuable strategic and tactical targets in a battle which are of far more importance than any other ship engaged in battle, and in some circumstances, every other ship engaged in battle. Maximizing the effectiveness with which a single valuable target can be identified and destroyed can be of great strategic value.

SHP_STRAT_DEFENSE
Strategic Defense

SHP_STRAT_DEFENSE_DESC

SHP_NEUTRONIUM_ARM_DESC
Neutronium is one of the densest substances in the universe, naturally occurring or otherwise. As such, it is extremely difficult even break it into manageable pieces for transport. Through advanced metallurgical processes however, Neutronium can theoretically be plated on to many military vessels.

SHP_MIL_ROBO_CONT
Military Robotic Control

SHP_MIL_ROBO_CONT_DESC
Robotic control can be used effectively for tasks such as farming, mining and industry; the natural extension of this concept is to develop military robotic equipment capable of independently operating a starship. This would allow greater versatility in design, as the necessity for bulky life-support systems would be removed. Hulls produced with such technology could also perform dangerous repairs without thought for the safety and biological limitations of living engineers.

SHP_SPACE_FLUX_DRIVE
Spatial Flux Drive

SHP_SPACE_FLUX_DRIVE_DESC
Ordinarily, propulsion in space is limited to either propellant or field propulsion. On relatively small scales however, it is possible to propel an object in space much like one could in water: by pushing backwards the medium in which the object is immersed. This requires the manipulation of space itself whereby the smallest units of space are collapsed, forcing the matter they once contained into adjacent units of space. This method of propulsion is very efficient, but dangerous on larger scales and easily detectable due to the dimensional effects.

SHP_CONTGRAV_MAINT
Contra-Gravitational Maintenance

SHP_CONTGRAV_MAINT_DESC
When the mass of the ship surpasses a certain threshold, it becomes necessary to consider the gravitational stresses on vital architectural points in the ship's structure. These points will be unable to withstand the gravitational stresses and collapse, destroying the vessel. This necessitates nearly constant maintenance of these points to avoid total structural failure.

SHP_NANOROBO_MAINT
Nano-Robotic Maintenance

SHP_NANOROBO_MAINT_DESC
Just as nanorobots can be used for production, so also can they be used for maintenance. A hull with a complement of centrally organized nanite engineers would be able to rapidly repair damage, even during combat. Such machines would have great difficulty distinguishing organic beings from a part of the hull in need of repair however, and as such this concept could only be applied to automated hulls.

SHP_MASSPROP_SPEC
Mass-Propulsion Specialization

SHP_MASSPROP_SPEC_DESC
Traditional propulsion devices operate well on objects of relatively low mass. However, when the mass of a ship approaches that of a small moon, ordinary methods of propulsion are very clumsy and require tremendous amounts of energy. A new approach to propulsion, taking into account the size of the object in question as a fundamental aspect of the system, could allow such vessels to have useful mobility.

SHP_TRANSSPACE_DRIVE
Trans-Spatial Drive

SHP_TRANSSPACE_DRIVE_DESC
Even when spatial dimensions are skewed by relativistic effects, an object generally has constant space-time characteristics. By creating a device which alters the characteristics of space-time itself using quasi-relativistic effects, it would be possible to create a fast, stealthy method of propulsion. 

SHP_MIDCOMB_LOG
Mid-Combat Logistics

SHP_MIDCOMB_LOG_DESC
When interstellar fleets are in regular, commonplace use, the transfer of personnel and materiel in the absence of enemy ships is a relatively trivial task. In combat however, when such transfers could potentially have great tactical merit, there is great difficulty with the coordinational aspects of logistics due to the possibility of sudden changes in the tactical scenario. By using a single mobile command station, it is possible to organize and enact logistic patterns in the midst of combat.

SHP_ASTEROID_HULLS
Asteroid Hulls

SHP_ASTEROID_HULLS_DESC
Rather than constructing a hull from scratch, it is far easier to take a pre-existing space-borne object and adapt it to fill the role of a ship's hull. Not only would such ships be very inexpensive to produce, but they would also be able to avoid detection by enemy ships by hiding amongst other asteroids.

SHP_ASTEROID_REFORM
Asteroid Reformation

SHP_ASTEROID_REFORM_DESC
'''This massive hull is formed by combining several large asteroids. It has fifteen external slots and four internal slots. Structure is good, but speed is very low. This hull gets a large bonus to stealth on the galaxy map when it is in a system with an asteroid belt, and in combat when it is hiding in an asteroid belt.

While modifying asteroids to serve as ship's hulls is very efficient, it is limited by the available sizes and shapes of available asteroids. By combining or breaking apart asteroids, asteroid hulls of extremely large or small sizes could be produced.'''

SHP_MONOMOLEC_LATTICE
Monomolecular Latticing

SHP_MONOMOLEC_LATTICE_DESC
Asteroid Hulls can be reinforced and armor plated, but the fact remains that the basic substance of which most asteroids are primarily composed is of lesser strength than most modern alloys. However, if the molecular structure of the rock itself were to be rearranged into a crystal lattice, its strength could be increased tremendously, allowing the production of asteroid hulls of previously impossible strengths.

SHP_MULTICELL_CAST
Multi-Cellular Casting

SHP_MULTICELL_CAST_DESC
Even when it is inert, organic material is much more versatile than standard materials. A non-living multi-cellular ship would provide some of the advantages of organic materials without the customary nuisances of organic life.

SHP_DOMESTIC_MONSTER
Domesticated Mega-Fauna

SHP_DOMESTIC_MONSTER_DESC
'''Though huge and alien the time-tested arts of domestication can also be applied to the space monsters that travel the starlanes. Building Colonies or Outposts at monster nests will enable the raising of domesticated monsters.'''

SHP_HAB_MEGAFAUN
Habitable Mega-Fauna

SHP_HAB_MEGAFAUN_DESC
It is generally uncommon to find comfortable living conditions within a gigantic space monster. This is exactly what must exist within an organic hull however, if it is to be adequately controlled from within. The development of massive, habitable creatures opens up numerous possibilities for ship design.

SHP_MONOCELL_EXP
Mono-Cellular Expansion

SHP_MONOCELL_EXP_DESC
Multi-cellular organisms tend to have longer life spans than single celled organisms due to specialization and interdependency. However, with the appropriate technological refinements, these aspects of multi-cellular life can be applied to a massive mono-cellular organism, allowing it to have practical functionality in combat.

SHP_CONT_SYMB
Contrived Symbiosis

SHP_CONT_SYMB_DESC
Any ship's hull is in a symbiotic relationship with its makers in that they bring it into being and sustain it, and it performs its desired functions. However, this is a purely behavioral type of symbiosis. Through careful planning and design, an organic ship can be made to have a biological symbiotic relationship with its crew, each providing the other with the essentials of life.

SHP_CONT_BIOADAPT
Controlled Bioadaption

SHP_CONT_BIOADAPT_DESC
It is very difficult to predict the actions of a living being to any useful degree of certainty without having an intimate understanding of its behavioral patterns. By placing a life form under harshly competitive developmental conditions, its behavioral patterns can be manipulated, strengthened and effectively utilized in war.

SHP_BIONEUR_SPEC
Bio-Neural Specialization

SHP_BIONEUR_SPEC_DESC
As a species evolves mental capabilities, the individuals whose minds are not perfectly attuned to the needs of their bodies cannot compete with those whose minds are perfectly specialized for their bodies. Thus, all evolved life forms have nearly ideal mental development for their type of body. There are no such guarantees for artificial life forms however, and often the true potential of such a being is unrealized due to subtle incompatibilities between mind and body. By specializing the organism's neural patterns to conform to its body type, these incompatibilities can be eliminated.

SHP_FRC_ENRG_COMP
Force-Energy Compression

SHP_FRC_ENRG_COMP_DESC
Typically, the manipulation of energy requires it to be in the form of matter so that potential energy can be stored as desired and released on demand. Matter converted to pure energy stored in the fabric of space-time itself would be more versatile than any material substance, but impossible to contain without advanced force-field technology.

SHP_QUANT_ENRG_MAG
Quantum Energy Magnification

SHP_QUANT_ENRG_MAG_DESC
'''This hull magnifies quantum energy fluctuations to increase its own power. It has seven external slots and three internal slots. Speed and structure are very high, but stealth is very low. This hull requires a very great deal of energy to construct and can only be build at a system with a star of type Blue or Black Hole.

Due to quantum uncertainty, it is possible for a particle to arbitrarily gain a small amount of energy or for new particles to temporarily enter existence. By detecting and magnifying these fluctuations in quantum energy, it would be possible to tremendously increase the capabilities of an energy hull.'''

SHP_ENRG_BOUND_MAN
Energy Boundary Manipulation

SHP_ENRG_BOUND_MAN_DESC
'''Whether constructed, grown, or adapted from a pre-existing structure, ships composed of matter must have a logical and co-ordinated structure to allow even basic utility. Pure energy however, has no such restrictions. This allows a pure energy hull to take on any form whatsoever, however impractical it would be from a material standpoint.

This hull, while small, has a fractal surface which allows many more parts to be mounted than would be possible on a smoother hull. It has twenty-seven external slots, but no internal slots. Stealth is very low, but structure and speed are average. This hull requires a very great deal of energy to construct and can only be built at a system with a star of type Blue or Black Hole.'''
SHP_SOLAR_CONT
Solar Containment

SHP_SOLAR_CONT_DESC
'''A hull constructed from pure energy, while far more versatile than a solid hull, has a disadvantage in that it is unable to harness the potential energy of material objects. If, however, it were made possible to contain a hull composed not of pure energy, but of super-heated gases constantly undergoing a self-sustaining fusion reaction, the limitations of both pure energy and solid matter could be avoided.

This mighty flagship is essentially a miniature sun, and as such is a great source of both fuel and visibility. All accompanying friendly ships completely recover fuel between combat, and all enemy ships in the vicinity receive a penalty to stealth. This hull has eighteen external slots and nine internal slots - a far greater internal capacity than any other hull. Structure is extremely high, but speed and stealth are very low. However, this ship has the ability to enter a star and hide, giving it perfect stealth on the galaxy map when it is in a system with a star of type other than Black Hole or Neutron, and in combat, when it is hiding inside such a star. This ship requires a tremendous amount of energy to construct and must harness energy from particle-antiparticle collisions on the event horizon of a Black Hole in its formation.'''

CON_ORBITAL_CON
Orbital Construction

CON_ORBITAL_CON_DESC
'''Increases the max resource supply range of all colonies by 1.

On a planet, there is always a fixed reference direction: "up". Microgravity is effectively isotropic. This single difference has a multitude of consequences for the types of structures that can be built, and which of those forms is the optimal use of space, materials and energy in each environment. As well, the interior configuration of spaces in orbit must be rethought. However, while it is appealing to attempt to completely revolutionize interior design in a paradigm completely independent of the styles used on planet surfaces, the practical use of these spaces will be initial primarily by those who are used to, and adapted for, those planet surfaces. Rather than a complete break from older styles, a gradual transition may be more effective.'''

CON_SUBTER_CONST
Subterranean Construction

CON_SUBTER_CONST_DESC
'''If this planet is inhabitable, increases the Population capacity of this planet by 2.  Cannot improve a planet with the Tunnels or Techtonic Instability special.

When space is at a premium, the ability to build downwards as well as up is an invaluable asset. Entire underground cities and facilities can be constructed and maintained, and trans-planetary subterranean transportation routes can be established.'''

CON_SPACE_ELEVATOR
Space Elevator

CON_SPACE_ELEVATOR_DESC
Nano-construction enables production of tensile cables strong enough to reach beyond geostationary orbit. Shuttles magnetically lifted up the cable are superior to the expensive, inefficient, and highly dangerous rocket launches to escape velocity.

CON_CONC_CAMP
Concentration Camps

CON_CONC_CAMP_DESC
Typically, when forced to work to death, citizens will put up some resistance and have the sympathy and support of outside observers. However, by carefully creating buildings designed to quench the fire of justice within outsiders, and to promote feelings of worthlessness and subservience in those on the inside, concentration camps can be effectively utilized without fear of revolt.

CON_FRC_ENRG_CAMO
Force-Energy Camouflage

CON_FRC_ENRG_CAMO_DESC
'''Increases the Stealth of all buildings by 50.

Ordinary physical structures tend to be both opaque and rigid, being constructed from similarly opaque and rigid natural materials. A force field does not, of necessity, possess these features in any permanent sense, and can be turned on and off or changed from one color to another at will. While most buildings are easily visible from many uus away with a powerful detection apparatus, a force-energy structure - or a regular structure surrounded by a series of camouflage force-fields - would be essentially invisible from great distances.'''

CON_PLANET_DRIVE
Planetary Starlane Drive

CON_PLANET_DRIVE_DESC
Planets in the outermost systems of an empire are often in great danger of attack from enemy fleets, yet these planets can often contain extremely valuable resources and specials. By equipping an entire planet with the means to open and navigate a starlane, it would be possible to move such planets to a safer location in times of necessity.

CON_STARGATE
Stargate

CON_STARGATE_DESC
Particularly in more expansive empires, the need to move ships to a specific defensive location in great haste often exceeds the feasibility. By creating a warp between two or more points in space-time, it can be made possible to move ships even across an entire empire at need, allowing new offensive and defensive strategies.

CON_ART_PLANET
Artificial Planet

CON_ART_PLANET_DESC
Gas giants and asteroid belts offer unique opportunities and resources, not only as sites for acquiring valuable - and on occasion extremely rare - resources, but as raw materials in and of themselves for the production of artificial planets. Such planets would offer new centres for production in previously empty or entirely occupied systems. In addition, various key features of the planet can be modified or added during the construction process, potentially allowing the planets size and environment to be specified, or certain planet specials to be added.

CON_PALACE_EXCLUDE
Palace Excluder

CON_PALACE_EXCLUDE_DESC
Ensures that only one imperial palace will be present in an empire at a time. Make sure you scrap your old imperial palace before your new one is built.

GRO_INDUSTRY_FARM
Industrial Farming

GRO_INDUSTRY_FARM_DESC
Traditional, simple farming methods are sufficient for small, locally self-sufficient populations without significant limits on available space or time. With greater specialization of more advanced societies however, fewer farmers must feed many more workers from much greater distances away, including even interstellar food shipment for fledgling colonies or major industrial centres. This dependency on interstellar shipping routes makes industrial worlds extremely vulnerable to blockade by enemy forces. By gradually adapting factories and adding supplementary infrastructure over a long period of time, waste matter and energy can be used to grow food with no extra cost, allowing industrial planets a small supply of food in great need.

GRO_GENOME_BANK
Genome Bank

GRO_GENOME_BANK_DESC
The unknown variables in genomic calculations for any given species remain severe for all but the simplest genetic repairs, not to mention the changes that a genetic modification can potentially have on a larger multi-species biosphere. To truly realize the benefits of genetic medicine, it is necessary to collect a massive genome database for all the species from all known worlds.

GRO_INDUSTRY_CLONE
Industrial Cloning

GRO_INDUSTRY_CLONE_DESC
Primitive manual nuclear transfer cloning techniques are little more than novelties for large organisms. By applying techniques similar to industrial mass production or biochemical process engineering, it becomes possible to generate dozens, or millions, of full-grown copies of a single genetic blueprint. Populations may be made to order, tailored to meet the specific needs of society.

GRO_SUSPENDED_ANIMATION
Suspended Animation

GRO_SUSPENDED_ANIMATION_DESC
Through chemical manipulation and cryonics, life processes may be halted without terminating them permanently. Beings in this state are preserved indefinitely, consume no resources and require very little storage - not living - space. With this technique, the capacity of colony ships can be greatly increased.

GRO_ORBIT_FARMING
Orbital Farming

GRO_ORBIT_FARMING_DESC
'''Increases target Farming on all planets by 2, regardless of focus and environment.

The primary energy source for food production in most societies is solar radiation. Bound to a planet, farms have very limited access to this energy, due to the comparatively small solid angle subtended by the planet's surface and other land uses competing with surface farming. By moving food production to orbital installations, continuous access to solar energy is gained, and any undesired spectral filtration by planetary atmospheres is eliminated.'''

GRO_TERRAFORM
Terraforming

GRO_TERRAFORM_DESC
Changing the environmental type of a planet is a massive undertaking, the challenge of this process is to a large degree logistical. The precise method depends greatly on the type of planet to be changed and the desired result. However, in all cases much of the surface of the entire planet and its atmosphere needs to be converted to other types of molecules, vented into space or buried under the crust. As such, this process requires most of the planet to be accessible to the terraformers, and cannot be performed on a world with max population less than one.

GRO_TERRAFORM_SHORT_DESC
Allows terraforming

GRO_REMOTE_TERRAFORM
Remote Terraforming

GRO_REMOTE_TERRAFORM_DESC
Traditional terraforming methods treat the planet as a structure and attempt to alter its environment through physical and chemical means. This necessitates that the majority of the planet be accessible to the terraforming species, which generally limits its usefulness. By treating the planet as an organism and altering its physiology indirectly, it is possible to make use of less labour intensive, though more time consuming terraforming methods, allowing outposts on poor and hostile worlds to make use of terraforming.

GRO_BIOTERROR
Bioterror Facilites

GRO_BIOTERROR_DESC
A research centre created to safely develop the most dangerous of biological weaponry while keeping prying eyes out. Biological weaponry takes effect too slowly to be of much use in a direct military conflict, but as a weapon of terror it is unsurpassed; a slowly growing contamination will spread panic before it, images of a desperate people quarantined by their own government sowing despair beyond the affected area. However, care must be taken when developing such organisms to ensure they are not accidentally released. Furthermore, utter secrecy is required to dispel the risk of damaging relations with civilians and other empires.

GRO_REMOTE_TERRAFORM_SHORT_DESC
Allows remote terraforming

GRO_CYBORG
Cyborgs

GRO_CYBORG_DESC
'''Increases the population capacity of Hostile planets to 0.5, 1, 1.5, and 2 for Small, Medium, Large and Huge planets, respectively. Increases Health on Hostile by 10. [[NO_NON_ORGANIC]]

A highly versatile fusion of organism and machine, capable of adapting to a tremendous variety of circumstances. Spontaneous generation of specialized organs and mechanically enhanced strength permit cyborgs to exist with ease in nearly any environment.'''

GRO_GAIA_TRANS
Gaia Transformation

GRO_GAIA_TRANS_DESC
Theoretically, it is possible to completely predict the ecology of a single planet by mapping out its entire web of biological interdependence, both sentient and non-sentient, in fractal algorithms. In practice however, this could only be realized by constructing a vast planet-spanning network running a computer program dedicated to regulating the planet's entire biosphere. This computer would become, in effect, the brain of a new type of life - a single planetary organism, with intelligent citizens as part of its fabric, subject to the greater will.

GRO_GAIA_TRANS_SHORT_DESC
Allows Gaia Transformation

LRN_OBSERVATORY_I
Observatory

LRN_OBSERVATORY_I_DESC
Studying and understanding the nature of stars and their internal and external attributes provides powerful insight into the nature of stellar phenomena and planetary bodies. Furthermore, fractal algorithms can be employed to decipher the dispersal of starlanes throughout the galaxy, allowing any stars which are in some way connected, however indirectly, to the known network of starlanes to be identified an monitored.

LRN_SOLAR_MAN
Solar Manipulation

LRN_SOLAR_MAN_DESC
Different star types not only have their own distinct attributes and opportunities for exploitation, but also tend to give rise to a particular planet type. Often, a star of a particular type will give a desired bonus, but will almost certainly be devoid of any desirable planets, or will not be present in an opportune location in the galaxy. By manipulating the high-energy reactions within a star's core, it would be possible to either reverse or accelerate the natural processes within the star, allowing it to be changed to an entirely different type at need.

LRN_DISTRIB_THOUGHT
Distributed Thought Computing

LRN_DISTRIB_THOUGHT_DESC
'''Multiplies target Research on all planets with the Research focus by 1.25.

The average citizen literally wastes his mind away, one of the finest computing devices in the universe. By tapping into the idle brain cycles of a sufficiently large population through a network of simple cybernetic transceivers, the research centers of a world can gain access to cheap and plentiful raw computing power.'''

LRN_STELLAR_TOMOGRAPHY
Stellar Tomography

LRN_STELLAR_TOMOGRAPHY_DESC
'''Multiplies target Research on planets with the Research focus by 2, 1.75, 1.5, or 1.25 in systems with Black Hole stars, Neutron stars, Blue or white stars, and Yellow, Orange or Red stars, respectively.

A network of specialized satellites can use tomographic methods to reconstruct the activities occurring deep within a star. These otherwise costly-to-produce conditions are ideal for a variety of research endeavors, with larger benefits for more exotic star types.'''

LRN_SPATIAL_DISTORT_GEN
Spatial Distortion Generator

LRN_SPATIAL_DISTORT_GEN_DESC
'''By manipulating the dimensional properties of a starlane, it would be possible to selectively bend it so that an incoming ship of sufficiently low speed would inadvertently arrive back where it began, having wasted its time and fuel.

Alternatively, such a ship may be sent randomly along a completely different starlane adjacent to the building.'''

LRN_GATEWAY_VOID
Gateway to the Void

LRN_GATEWAY_VOID_DESC
The power of the Void Mind is almost imperceptible in a mere four-dimensional space-time. By creating a permanent gateway accessing an immense number of dimensions, a dangerous, non-discriminating force can be unleashed in a localized area.

LRN_ENCLAVE_VOID
Enclave of the Void

LRN_ENCLAVE_VOID_DESC
Study of the Void Mind could be accelerated by genetically engineering the populace of an entire world to be attuned to the Void. This new priestly class could transform the entire social structure of their world to better understand and channel the wisdom of the Void Mind to the entire empire.

LRN_ART_BLACK_HOLE
Artificial Black Hole

LRN_ART_BLACK_HOLE_DESC
By carefully collapsing a red star, a Black Hole can be formed. This is an expensive and dangerous task, but with great potential benefits for Research and Industry.

LRN_PSY_DOM
Psychogenic Domination

LRN_PSY_DOM_DESC
'''Has a 10% chance of taking control of any enemy ship within one starlane jump of a colony owned by the empire, provided that the ship is not owned by an empire who also has this tech.

It is difficult to force a conscious individual to submit to the total mental control of another entity against its will. By manipulating the timeframes involved however, the mental force exerted by a population over a period of hours may be brought to bear on a single individual in the span of a few seconds, creating an almost irresistible compulsion to join the unified mind.'''

LRN_RUINS_MOD
Ancient Ruins Modifier

LRN_RUINS_MOD_DESC
Due to the order in which effects groups are processed, the Ancient Ruins special cannot have the desired effect of multiplying research on the planet where it is located. This technology makes it possible.

MIND_CONTROL_SHORT_DESC
Allows Mind Control

PRO_HEAVY_MINING_I
Heavy Mining Processors

PRO_HEAVY_MINING_I_DESC
When increased minerals production is the only concern, no environmental damage considerations exist and the environment itself is conducive, partially automated bulk mining activities can be optimal. Heavy mining processors are expensive however, and are only practical to use on worlds with primary focus mining. As well, these processors severely damage the ecology of a planet, reducing its maximum population and health somewhat.

PRO_ASTEROID_MINE
Asteroid Mining

PRO_ASTEROID_MINE_DESC
'''Permits use of the Mining focus on asteroid belts.

Mineral resource extraction from sub-planetoid-sized bodies involves challenges and provides opportunities quite distinct from those of full-fledged planets. Lacking sufficient mass to self-liquify and differentiate, asteroids can provide much easier access to some heavier elements, and lack of a gravity can make extraction for use in space much more efficient. Conversely, the limited size of each source asteroid requires fully portable self-sufficient extraction facilities. As well, the challenges of any microgravity environment must be overcome, requiring redesign of many traditional methods.'''

PRO_ORBITAL_MINE
Orbital Mining

PRO_ORBITAL_MINE_DESC
'''Permits use of the Mining focus on planetary outposts.

On solid, habitable planets, traditional bulk surface mining is effective and relatively efficient. For gas giants and terrestrial planets that are unable to support a sizable population however, the ability to extract usable minerals with space-based facilities is far more practical. A primary challenge to this method is overcoming the planetary gravity well, but once this is accomplished, vast new sources of minerals become available. As well, specialized resources on uninhabitable planets become accessible for the first time.'''

PRO_SOL_ORB_GEN
Solar Orbital Generation

PRO_SOL_ORB_GEN_DESC
Traditional solar generation methods rely solely on radiating solar energy. By placing generators in low orbit around the star itself, the ability to directly harness the energy of supermassive stellar phenomena becomes a possibility, and a sizable and far-reaching benefit to industry can be obtained.

PRO_INDUSTRY_CENTER_I
Industrial Centers

PRO_INDUSTRY_CENTER_I_DESC
'''Coordinating industrial activity between planets and star systems can be effectively accomplished at large centralized complexes.

Facility's large cost and build time, as well as significant future range growth potential, require strong planning to produce in location with ideal future utility. Industrial Centers come with large up-front cost, in both production resources and time, but with great opportunity for possible expansion. This makes them ideal for long-term strategies, but unattractive for empires planning on a quick victory.'''

PRO_NEUTRONIUM_FAC
Neutronium Facilities

PRO_NEUTRONIUM_FAC_DESC
By extracting neutronium from a neutron star, it is possible to utilize it in the construction of otherwise impossible ship parts.

PRO_INDUSTRY_MOD

DEF_LIGHTHOUSE_DESC
By using a complex pattern of EM pulses and particle streams to reveal the location of objects in a system, it is possible for even very stealthy objects to be illuminated and detected with moderate detection equipment.

DEF_DEFENSE_NET
Planetary Defense Network

DEF_DEFENSE_NET_DESC
'''Increases max defense on all planets by 5.

With galactic exploration comes the possibility of meeting new races - and new enemies. By placing several armed defense bases in orbit around a planet, it is possible to give that planet defensive capabilities without the need for ships.'''

DEF_HI_ENRG_FOCUS
High Energy Focus

DEF_HI_ENRG_FOCUS_DESC
'''Increases max defense on all planets by 15.

While having a multitude of defense satellites is superior to a single large defense satellite in terms of versatility and dependability, it is considerably inferior in terms of firepower. Often, enemy shields can simply absorb numerous weak attacks where a single powerful attack would be able to penetrate its shields and severely damage the ship. By using a high energy focusing device, the power of multiple defense satellites can be unified into a single powerful beam weapon.'''

SHP_REINFORCED_HULL_DESC
'''Increases max structure of all ships by 5.

Standard ship hulls are designed and constructed with advanced microgravity architectural techniques and highly resistant materials. However, the limitations of physical matter impose a severe limitation on the strength of hulls. By enhancing the hull with structural integrity fields, a sizable increase in strength can be obtained.'''

SHP_BASIC_DAM_CONT
Basic Damage Control

SHP_BASIC_DAM_CONT_DESC
Gradually repairs damaged ships. Current structure of all ships is replenished at a rate of 1 per turn.

SHP_ADV_DAM_CONT

Fully repairs damaged ships between battles.

SHP_SYST_DEF_MINE
System Defense Mines

SHP_SYST_DEF_MINE_DESC
'''When friendly ships are not present in a system, enemy ships are free to blockade the system, stopping the transfer of resources without directly engaging the planet's defenses, thus with no risk of damage to themselves. A network of system defense mines can deter these tactics by damaging enemy ships each turn they are in the system.

The structure of all ships belonging to an enemy empire which are present in a system containing a planet owned by the empire that possesses this technology will be reduced at a rate of 2 per turn.

The mines have a lifetime of one turn; they are gone by the time combat begins in a system and are replaced in time for the next turn.'''

This is a hazardous journey even if the planet survives however, and only half the population of a planet will live even with support from the interstellar lighthouse. This building can be built at an outpost, but not on an asteroid belt.

Due to a lack of UI targeting, a second building is currently required on the other end of the starlane. This building will destroy itself immediately, so that the planet can move to a different target system later.

'''This living hull has mind and body working in perfect unison, allowing it to react and adapt to its surroundings with unparalleled efficiency. It has only two of each internal and external slots, but stealth, speed and structure are all very high. This hull regenerates fuel and completely recovers structure between combats.

Requires a Basic Shipyard, an Orbital Incubator and a Bioneural Modification Unit at the planet where it is developed.'''

SH_SENTIENT
Sentient Hull

SH_SENTIENT_DESC
'''This self-aware flagship has powerful analytical abilities and a tremendous memory capacity, which allow it to direct friendly vessels and provide them with useful information and subtle tactical cues in combat, giving a stealth and detection bonus to all accompanying friendly ships. It has six external slots and three internal slots. It has low speed, but stealth and structure are good. This hull regenerates structure and fuel between combats.

Requires a Basic Shipyard, an Orbital Incubator, a Competitive Maturation Chamber and a Bioneural Modification Unit at the planet where it is developed.'''

SH_COMPRESSED_ENERGY
Compressed Energy Hull

SH_COMPRESSED_ENERGY_DESC
'''This fast hull is comprised entirely of compressed energy and has a single external slot. Structure is low, but stealth and speed are very high. This hull requires a great deal of energy to construct and can only be built at a system with a star of type White, Blue or Black Hole.

Requires a Basic Shipyard and an Energy Compressor at the planet where it is formed.'''

SH_FRACTAL_ENERGY
Fractal Energy Hull

SH_FRACTAL_ENERGY_DESC
'''This hull, while small, has a fractal surface which allows many more parts to be mounted than would be possible on a smoother hull. It has twenty-seven external slots, but no internal slots. Stealth is very low, but structure and speed are average. This hull requires a very great deal of energy to construct and can only be built at a system with a star of type Blue or Black Hole.

Requires a Basic Shipyard, an Energy Compressor and a Controlled Energy Focusing Array at the planet where it is formed.'''

SH_QUANTUM_ENERGY
Quantum Energy Hull

SH_QUANTUM_ENERGY_DESC
'''This hull magnifies quantum energy fluctuations to increase its own power. It has seven external slots and three internal slots. Speed and structure are very high, but stealth is very low. This hull requires a very great deal of energy to construct and can only be built at a system with a star of type Blue or Black Hole.

Requires a Basic Shipyard, an Energy Compressor and a Controlled Energy Focusing Array at the planet where it is formed.'''

SH_SOLAR
Solar Hull

SH_SOLAR_DESC
'''This mighty flagship is essentially a miniature sun, and as such is a great source of both fuel and visibility. All accompanying friendly ships completely recover fuel between combat, and all enemy ships in the vicinity receive a penalty to stealth. This hull has eighteen external slots and nine internal slots - a far greater internal capacity than any other hull. Structure is extremely high, but speed and stealth are very low. However, this ship has the ability to enter a star and hide, giving it perfect stealth on the galaxy map when it is in a system with a star of type other than Black Hole or Neutron, and in combat, when it is hiding inside such a star. This ship requires a tremendous amount of energy to construct and must harness energy from particle-antiparticle collisions on the event horizon of a Black Hole in its formation.

Requires a Basic Shipyard, an Energy Compressor and a Solar Containment Unit at the planet where it is built.'''
