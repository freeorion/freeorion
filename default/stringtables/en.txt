FREEORION_VISION
FreeOrion, an open-source game based on Master of Orion, is a turn-based game of epic space strategy that builds on the classic '4X' model by incorporating the nation-building elements of games such as Europa Universalis 2 and a versatile tactical combat engine. While its modular, open-source design allows for a significant degree of customization of the game engine and the story elements by the community, the FreeOrion team is dedicated to the construction of a living, breathing universe in a 'grand campaign' model.

Total Available Points relates to the PP available across your entire empire.
Points Available Here are the maximum available for the selected system.  This may be less than the total available when all of your empire's systems are not [[metertype METER_SUPPLY]] connected.
Wasted Points will be lost, if not allocated before ending the turn.


<u>Producible Items panel</u>

(default position: bottom edge)
The Producible Items panel contains items available to start a Production Order.
Toggle the display of item types or availability by clicking on the column headers.
Items may be added to the Production Queue as a Production Order by double clicking on them or with the right click menu.
Each item type has a column for total cost and minimum time.
The maximum PP that may be allotted to any Production Order is (cost / time) x quantity.
e.g. an item type with a total cost of 30 PP and a minimum time of 3 turns can progress by up to 10 PP per item, per turn.
Unavailable items, if displayed, will detail the reasons they are unavailable at the bottom of their tooltip in red (hover the mouse over the item).

<u>Production Queue panel</u>

(default position: left edge, below summary)
The Production Queue panel contains Production Orders previously enqueued.
Production Points are allotted to the Production Orders starting at the top of the queue.
Any orders for the currently selected system will highlight the system name with your empires color (top right of the order).
These orders may be rearranged in the queue by dragging and dropping to a new position.
Right clicking on an order will show a menu for moving, removing, or pausing an order (as well as other possible actions, such as <i>Show in Pedia</i> ).
When removing an order any previous progress on it is lost, there is no credit returned or given to other orders.
Pausing an order prevents any progress on it until the order is resumed.
For ships, an additional menu item is available to Rally to a system.  Once the order completes, the ship(s) will have a waypoint assigned for the system rallied to.  To set or change a Rally destination, select the desired system on the map, right click the Production Order, and select <i>Rally to </i>... (where ... is the system name).


<u>Production Order</u>

A Production Order is created through the Producible Items panel and is placed into the Production Queue panel.
Each order defines a repetition count (1⟳) and a quantity (1x), selectable in the top left of the order.
The repetition count will repeat the order after it completes, without adjusting the position in the queue.
The quantity defines how many of the item will be produced each repetition.

<i>Note</i>  Repetitions will only consume enough PP for the current iteration, unless the order will complete next turn.
If the order will complete, some PP are allowed to start the next iteration, up to the maximum allowed per turn for that item type.


<u>Example</u>

Your empire produces 10 PP per turn.
A Survey Ship costs 36 PP with a minimum of 3 turns (max 12 PP/turn).
(For brevity, this fictional Survey Ship does not increase [[encyclopedia FLEET_UPKEEP_TITLE]])
-Turn  1: You queue an order for Survey Ship and set the repetition count to 2. (order #1)
                You queue another order for Survey Ship with a repetition of 2. (order #2)
                You queue another order for Survey Ship and set the quantity to 2.

-Turn  2: Order #1 has completed 10 PP, 26 PP remain.  10 PP is projected for next turn.

    (Completed PP / Remaining PP to complete -> Projected next turn)

-Turn  3: Order #1 20 / 16 -> 10

-Turn  4: Order #1 30 /   6 ->   6  an additional 4 PP will go to the next repetition of this order.

-Turn  5: A Survey Ship is produced (order #1)
                Order #1   4 / 32 -> 10  now displays 1 repetition remains

-Turn  6: Order #1 14 / 22 -> 10

-Turn  7: Order #1 24 / 12 -> 10

-Turn  8: Order #1 34 /   2 ->   2
                Order #2   0 / 36 ->   8

-Turn  9: A Survey Ship is produced (order #1)
                Empire production increases to 22 PP per turn (for some unrelated reason).
                Order #2   8 / 28 -> 12  the max per turn for this project type
                Order #3   0 / 72 -> 10  (36 total cost x 2 quantity = 72 total cost)

-Turn 10: Order #2 20 / 16 -> 12
                 Order #3 10 / 62 -> 10

-Turn 11: Order #2 32 /    4 ->   4  an additional 12 PP will go to the next repetition
                 Order #3 20 / 52 ->   6  (22 - (4 + 12))

-Turn 12: A Survey Ship is produced (order #2)
                 Order #2 12 / 24 -> 12
                 Order #3 26 / 46 -> 10

-Turn 13: Order #2 24 / 12 -> 12
                 Order #3 36 / 36 -> 10

-Turn 14: A Survey Ship is produced (order #2)
                 Order #3 46 / 26 -> 22  (12 PP/turn x 2 quantity = max 24 PP/turn)

-Turn 15: Order #3 68 /   4 ->   4  (18 PP will be unused if no other items in queue)

-Turn 16: 2 Survey Ships are produced (order #3)

METER_INDUSTRY_VALUE_LABEL
Industry

METER_INDUSTRY_VALUE_DESC
'''Industry represents the production and modification of physical goods. It is needed to produce buildings, space ships and other projects.

The Industry of a planet can be used for any production projects of [[metertype METER_SUPPLY]] line connected planets. Any un-allocated Industry is lost each turn.

For information on the interface, see [[encyclopedia PRODUCTION_WINDOW_ARTICLE_TITLE]].
'''

METER_RESEARCH_VALUE_LABEL
Research

METER_RESEARCH_VALUE_DESC
'''The Research (or RP "Research Points") of all planets in the empire is combined to discover new [[encyclopedia ENC_TECH]].

Any Research that cannot be spent on a tech is lost each turn. Each tech has a minimum number of turns required to research it. For example, if a tech that cost 15 RPs, and had a minimum time of 3 turns, 5 RPs is the maximum that could be put towards its completion per turn.
The tech at the top of the queue is given RPs first. Any remaining RP are then given to the next tech in the queue, and if there is still more remaining to the next-- and so on. You can re-prioritize the items in the queue by dragging the most important items closer to the top.

Research does not require [[metertype METER_SUPPLY]] line connections to be used.'''

METER_TRADE_VALUE_LABEL
Trade

METER_CONSTRUCTION_VALUE_LABEL
Infrastructure

METER_CONSTRUCTION_VALUE_DESC
The term Infrastructure refers to technical structures that support a colonized planet: energy, transportation, telecommunication and social services for the citizens.

METER_HAPPINESS_VALUE_LABEL
Happiness

METER_HAPPINESS_VALUE_DESC
The Happiness of a colony's population starts out low after initial colonization or after invasion, and may also be affected by other factors.  A minimum Happiness of 5 is necessary for a colony to act as a source of settlers for colonizing other planets.

METER_CAPACITY_VALUE_LABEL
Stat - Primary

# TODO make this into a listing of possible capacity types
METER_CAPACITY_VALUE_DESC
The primary stat of an object.

METER_SECONDARY_STAT_VALUE_LABEL
Stat - Secondary

METER_SECONDARY_STAT_VALUE_DESC
The secondary stat of an object.

METER_FUEL_VALUE_LABEL
Fuel

METER_FUEL_VALUE_DESC
Fuel allows ships to travel the starlanes outside of [[metertype METER_SUPPLY]] of your empire. Fuel is consumed for each starlane traversed outside of supply; stopping within [[metertype METER_SUPPLY]] lines will fully refuel a ship. If a ship remains stationary beyond friendly [[metertype METER_SUPPLY]] lines, fuel will slowly regenerate. The amount of fuel a [[encyclopedia ENC_SHIP_DESIGN]] has depends on the [[encyclopedia ENC_SHIP_HULL]] used, but it can also be increased using some [[encyclopedia ENC_SHIP_PART]]s.

METER_SHIELD_VALUE_LABEL
Shields

METER_SHIELD_VALUE_DESC
'''The term Shields combines all kinds of protective force-fields. They are usually the first barrier incoming attacks have to overcome. There are two main types of shields: ship shields and planetary barrier shields, and both ships and planets have a Shields meter.  The main difference between them is simply how they recharge -- ship shields are able to recharge instantly after every single shot fired at them, whereas planetary barrier shields take more time to recharge.  The result of that seemingly small difference makes a very noticeable difference in combat, however.

Ship shields: Reduce the [[encyclopedia DAMAGE_TITLE]] sustained by each hit by the strength rating of the shield part. A weapon can only penetrate a shield if its damage value is higher than the shield's strength. However, ship shields do not negate shot damage coming from [[encyclopedia FIGHTER_TECHS]], as fighters fire from within the shields.

Planetary barrier shields: Act more like some kind of planetary armor. Their strength is reduced by each hit until they are completely depleted, at which point further hits will finally get through and damage planetary structures (first [[metertype METER_DEFENSE]] installations and then more general planetary [[metertype METER_CONSTRUCTION]]). Planetary barrier shields regenerate their strength each turn at a certain rate which can be affected by various technologies.

One further difference between the two types of shields is that a ship's shields may be partially or entirely suppressed by a type of interstellar field known as a [[fieldtype FLD_MOLECULAR_CLOUD]].
'''

METER_STRUCTURE_VALUE_LABEL
Structure

METER_STRUCTURE_VALUE_DESC
Structure is amount of [[encyclopedia DAMAGE_TITLE]] that ship can take until it is destroyed. Structure can be restored by repairing, and its max value increased with [[encyclopedia ARMOR_TITLE]].

METER_DEFENSE_VALUE_LABEL
Defense

METER_DEFENSE_VALUE_DESC
The Defense meter of a planet represents the power of the ground to space weapons installed. It's comparable to the [[encyclopedia DAMAGE_TITLE]] value of a space ship.

METER_SUPPLY_VALUE_LABEL
Supply

METER_SUPPLY_VALUE_DESC
'''The supply meter on a planet represents the number of star-lanes supply can extend through. Smaller planets can supply greater distances, large planets reduced distances.

Supply lines are shown by coloring star-lanes with an empire's color. Planets connected by supply lines form a 'Resource Group' and can share physical resources. Production Points created on one planet can be used on any connected planet to build ships or structures.

A set of core supply starlanes for an empire (the set of least-jump starlanes connecting the resource-producing systems of each Resource Group) will have greater thickness than the non-core starlanes.  If PP is currently being wasted within a Resource Group, the outer bands of the core starlanes will be a contrasting color.

Supply lines can also be used to refill the [[metertype METER_FUEL]] supply of ships.'''

METER_TROOPS_VALUE_LABEL
Troops

METER_TROOPS_VALUE_DESC
'''The term Troops combines all kinds of military forces capable of operating on a planet's surface.

The Troop meter on a planet represents the power of the defending ground forces. The invading force must send a more powerful force (i.e. a higher cumulative number) to conquer a planet.  Ships must be built with special parts for carrying troops, and such troops cannot invade if the defending planet has active [[metertype METER_SHIELD]].'''

METER_REBEL_TROOPS_VALUE_LABEL
Rebel Troops

METER_REBEL_TROOPS_VALUE_DESC
Occupying troops that are hostile to the objects owner.

METER_SIZE_VALUE_LABEL
Size

METER_SIZE_VALUE_DESC
An abstract value for the size of an object, group of objects, or area.

METER_STEALTH_VALUE_LABEL
Stealth

METER_STEALTH_VALUE_DESC
'''The term Stealth represents the ability of an object to dodge all kinds of sensors. Only empires with a [[encyclopedia DETECTION_TITLE]] higher than or equal to the Stealth value can see the object.

Space ships, buildings, specials, systems and planets have a Stealth meter.'''

METER_DETECTION_VALUE_LABEL
Detection Range

METER_DETECTION_VALUE_DESC
'''The Detection Range represents the distance in uu that sensors can reach. An empire can only see objects that have a [[metertype METER_STEALTH]] value lower than or equal to its [[encyclopedia DETECTION_TITLE]] and are within Detection Range of a controlled space ship or planet.

Space ships and planets have a Detection Range meter. There is the option to display Detection Range circles (in uu) in the Galaxy Map section of the Options menu.  To facilitate predictions of what would be within a Detection Range, there are also options to display a standard 'Map Scale Line' as well as a 'Map Scale Circle' centered on the currently selected system and indicating the same distance as the Map Scale Line.  They are both responsive to the the map zoom level and can be toggled via hotkeys.

Some objects or abilities may allow vision of certain areas outside of this range.  Some examples are from species abilities of [[species SP_TRITH]] or [[species SP_GEORGE]], or from the effects from a [[buildingtype BLD_SCRYING_SPHERE]].'''

METER_SPEED_VALUE_LABEL
Speed

METER_SPEED_VALUE_DESC
Speed on galaxy map  (uu/turn). The uu distance travelled by a ship in one turn is equal to its starlane speed value and is displayed on the map by a dotted line followed by a circle showing the number of turns required to travel the full starlane and reach the next system. If a ship starlane speed is less than the starlane length, it will require at least 2 turns to complete the journey. Each starlane traversed will consume only 1 unit of [[metertype METER_FUEL]], regardless of the turns required.

PEACE_TITLE
Peace

PEACE_TEXT
Peace is the diplomatic state between empires in which they mutually agree not to attack each other's ships or planets, not to obstruct each other's [[metertype METER_SUPPLY]] lines, and not to impede colonization.

OUTPOSTS_TITLE
Outpost

OUTPOSTS_TEXT
Outposts are unmanned stations, which can be founded in places too hostile for a colony to survive. They have no population, and normally produce no resources. But they create [[metertype METER_SUPPLY]] (with the right tech) and provide vision. Colonies can be founded on planets that already have an Outpost. To build an Outpost, you need to put an [[shippart CO_OUTPOST_POD]] on a ship. Outposts are also formed when the population of a colony drops to zero for any reason.

FOCUS_TITLE
Focus

FOCUS_TEXT
'''Each planet has a focus setting, dictating what the inhabitants will put more effort toward, such as [[metertype METER_INDUSTRY]] or [[metertype METER_RESEARCH]]. Not all areas of focus are always available. They may be restricted because the species can not focus on that area, the technology is not yet known, or other factors such as the availability of a [[encyclopedia ENC_SPECIAL]].

The focus of a planet may grant it bonuses or enable effects. A small penalty applies when changing a planets focus, which will diminish over time.

A planet will default to the inhabiting species' preferred focus if it has one, otherwise it will default to [[metertype METER_INDUSTRY]].'''

GROWTH_FOCUS_TITLE
Growth Focus

GROWTH_FOCUS_TEXT
'''The Growth Focus represents exporting rare materials and substances that can increase population of planets. Is only available in certain situations: on some homeworlds, and on planets with growth specials that can be exported.

A planet focused on Growth increases the max Population only of other planets connected to it by [[metertype METER_SUPPLY]] lines.

A Homeworld focused on Growth only helps other planets of the same species.

[[GROWTH_SPECIALS_ENTRY_LIST]]'''

TRADE_FOCUS_TITLE
Trade Focus

TRADE_FOCUS_TEXT
Trade doesn't do anything, yet. It is just a placeholder to show that more resources are planned.

PROTECTION_FOCUS_TITLE
Protection Focus

PROTECTION_FOCUS_TEXT
The Protection focus represents a planet wholly focused on defending itself. [[metertype METER_TROOPS]], Planetary [[metertype METER_DEFENSE]], and Planetary [[metertype METER_SHIELD]] are doubled.

ARMOR_TITLE
Armor Plating

ARMOR_TEXT
Increases the maximum [[metertype METER_STRUCTURE]] of its ship by the strength rating of the armor plating part.

SLOT_TITLE
Slot

SLOT_TEXT
A slot is a type of ship mount on a [[encyclopedia ENC_SHIP_HULL]], which can hold certain types of [[encyclopedia ENC_SHIP_PART]]s, like weapons, shields, armor plating, engines and various other devices. There are three slot types: external, internal, and core slots. [[encyclopedia ENC_SHIP_PART]] descriptions will state what kind of slots they are compatible with; some are compatble with multiple slot types.  This information is also shown graphically in the [[encyclopedia DESIGN_WINDOW_ARTICLE_TITLE]], where each type of slot in a hull is shown with a shape specific to its type. The [[encyclopedia ENC_SHIP_PART]]s in the Design Window are also shown with shapes that indicate which slots they are compatible with. In most cases a part shape will clearly match a particular slot-type shape.  Parts that can fit into multiple slot types will have shapes that are visibly compatible with the shapes of those slot types.  Larger (and expensive) hulls often have more slots available to be filled with parts.

DETECTION_TITLE
Detection Strength

DETECTION_TEXT
'''The term Detection Strength represents the technological level of an empire's sensors. An empire can only see objects that have a [[metertype METER_STEALTH]] value lower than or equal to its Detection Strength and are within [[metertype METER_DETECTION]] of a controlled space ship or planet.

Empires have a Detection Strength meter.'''

ENVIRONMENT_TITLE
Environment

ENVIRONMENT_TEXT
'''Different environments can be encountered when exploring the planetary systems on the galactic map: [[PT_INFERNO]], [[PT_RADIATED]], [[PT_TOXIC]], [[PT_BARREN]], [[PT_DESERT]], [[PT_TUNDRA]], [[PT_SWAMP]], [[PT_TERRAN]], [[PT_OCEAN]], [[PT_ASTEROIDS]], and [[PT_GASGIANT]].

Each [[encyclopedia ENC_SPECIES]] has its own environmental preferences, which determine on each planet type the suitability for the species, according to the following list (from worst to best):

[[PE_UNINHABITABLE]] < [[PE_HOSTILE]] < [[PE_POOR]] < [[PE_ADEQUATE]] < [[PE_GOOD]]

The planet suitability report can be displayed by right-cliking on a planet in the system sidepanel. A green number following the suitability data indicates the max population value if the species colonizes the planet, whereas a red number indicates that the population will stay idle or will decrease, to finally perish if the species attempts to colonize the planet.

When terraforming a planet (by [[metertype METER_RESEARCH]] or if the planet has the [[special GAIA_SPECIAL]] special) in order to better suit the species environmental preferences, the planet's original environment is modified by stages, until it finally reaches the [[PE_GOOD]] suitability for the species who wants to live on the planet. The terraforming stages can be checked on the suitability wheel displayed below.

Clockwise from top: [[PT_TERRAN]], [[PT_OCEAN]], [[PT_SWAMP]], [[PT_TOXIC]], [[PT_INFERNO]], [[PT_RADIATED]], [[PT_BARREN]], [[PT_TUNDRA]], [[PT_DESERT]]

ORGANIC_SPECIES_TITLE
Organic Metabolism

ORGANIC_SPECIES_TEXT
Organic species are more or less, 'life as we know it'. These species' max population can be increased when their connected homeworld is set on [[encyclopedia GROWTH_FOCUS_TITLE]], or when an Organic Growth Special is colonized, and focused on Growth. Organic Growth specials are marked with a little green 'O' in the corner.

LITHIC_SPECIES_TITLE
Lithic Metabolism

LITHIC_SPECIES_TEXT
Lithic species are silicon or mineral-based. These species' max population can be increased when their connected homeworld is set on [[encyclopedia GROWTH_FOCUS_TITLE]], or when a Lithic Growth Special is colonized, and focused on Growth. Lithic Growth specials are marked with a little grey 'L' in the corner.

Robotic species are sapient machines. These species' max population can be increased when their connected homeworld is set on [[encyclopedia GROWTH_FOCUS_TITLE]], or when a Robotic Growth Special is colonized, and focused on Growth. Robotic Growth specials are marked with a little red 'R' in the corner.

PHOTOTROPHIC_SPECIES_TITLE
Phototrophic Metabolism

PHOTOTROPHIC_SPECIES_TEXT
'''Phototrophic species live mainly or entirely on sunlight. These species' max population is greatly influenced by the brightness of the local star and the planet size - the brighter or bigger, the better. Growth specials do not benefit them.

SELF_SUSTAINING_SPECIES_TITLE
Self-Sustaining Metabolism

SELF_SUSTAINING_SPECIES_TEXT
Self-Sustaining species may be energy or crystalline beings or something even stranger. Their commonality is that they need no sustenance, so their max population is very high. While there are no specials that boost their growth, their max population is equal to a species that is provided with all three [[encyclopedia GROWTH_FOCUS_TITLE]] specials.

Telepathy

TELEPATHY_TEXT
Telepathic species are immune to mind-control and make it easier to research [[tech LRN_PSIONICS]].

XENOPHOBIC_SPECIES_TITLE
Xenophobic

XENOPHOBIC_SPECIES_TEXT
'''Xenophobic species will automatically divert some of their industrial efforts into harassing other species that are nearby. The affected nearby species will suffer an industrial penalty due to this harassment. A Xenophobic species of [[encyclopedia SELF_SUSTAINING_SPECIES_TITLE]] will also find the presence of alien species nearby to be disruptive to its natural balances (whether due to some direct effect or simply due to wasted energies being applied to harassing the alien species, has not been determined) resulting in a reduced maximum population.

Xenophobic species start with [[tech CON_CONC_CAMP]].'''

FLEET_UPKEEP_TITLE
Fleet Upkeep

FLEET_UPKEEP_TEXT
The cost of a fleet is more than the sum of the cost of its ships due to the operational costs associated with managing multiple ships. When producing new ships, costs increase by 1% for each ship already owned by the empire. The cost of the [[shippart CO_COLONY_POD]], [[shippart CO_SUSPEND_ANIM_POD]] and [[shippart CO_OUTPOST_POD]] as well as all the colony buildings instead increase by 6% for each planet already owned by the empire.

EVACUATION_TITLE
Evacuation Plan

EVACUATION_TEXT
'''The [[buildingtype BLD_EVACUATION]] when built will remove the population of a planet. Each turn some of the population will be removed. If there are planets colonized by the same species with free space, and connected by [[metertype METER_SUPPLY]] lines, one will be randomly chosen and the population will move there. If there are no appropriate planets available, the population disappears into the vastness of space.
During an evacuation, production drops to nothing. When the colony is empty, it reverts to an [[encyclopedia OUTPOSTS_TITLE]]. It still belongs to the same empire, and may be re-colonized once the [[buildingtype BLD_EVACUATION]] deletes itself.'''

AI_LEVELS_TITLE
AI Aggression Levels

AI_LEVELS_TEXT
'''AI aggression levels are meant to be roughly akin to difficulty levels, but not exactly, particularly in that they are differentiated in various aspects of risk-taking and aggression, with only some actual limitations being applied to the lower level ones. They can all still play pretty well, but the lower aggression ones may be a bit easier to manage, even if not necessarily easier to actually take over. The more aggressive ones do a bit better over the course of a game.

AIs rename their capital planet on turn 1, adding a prefix. Once you discover their home system you can determine their personality.

[[DESIGN_WND_STARTS]] has four tabs: empty [[DESIGN_WND_HULLS]], [[DESIGN_WND_FINISHED_DESIGNS]] designs, [[DESIGN_WND_SAVED_DESIGNS]] designs from previous games and [[DESIGN_WND_MONSTERS]] designs for inspection.  Drag or double click hulls, designs or monsters to edit/examine them on the workbench.

[[DESIGN_WND_FINISHED_DESIGNS]] designs appear in the same order as on the Production Window.  Designs can be drag-and-dropped within the list to change their order.  Delete designs with "[[DESIGN_OBSOLETE]]" from the context menu.  Ships already queued for production will continue to be built with the old design.  Save designs to disk for future games with "[[DESIGN_SAVE]]" from the context menu.

Right click [[DESIGN_WND_SAVED_DESIGNS]] designs and copy a single or all saved designs to the empire's known designs. If "[[OPTIONS_ADD_SAVED_DESIGNS]]" is activated in the game settings, all the [[DESIGN_WND_SAVED_DESIGNS]] designs will be automatically imported at the beginning of a whole new game.


[[DESIGN_WND_PART_PALETTE_TITLE]] displays parts. Parts whose associated technology has been researched may be used in current designs.  Other parts can not be used because either the associated technology has not been researched or the part is only available to monsters.

The "[[PRODUCTION_WND_AVAILABILITY_AVAILABLE]]" and "[[PRODUCTION_WND_AVAILABILITY_UNAVAILABLE]]" filters on [[DESIGN_WND_STARTS]] and [[DESIGN_WND_PART_PALETTE_TITLE]] toggle the display of parts that the empire can currently use or that are restricted.  Some unavailable parts may be unlocked by researching associated [[encyclopedia ENC_TECH]].

The [[DESIGN_WND_PART_PALETTE_TITLE]] window has filters to display/hide entire categories of parts.


[[DESIGN_WND_MAIN_PANEL_TITLE]] is the workbench for the current design.

The current design may have internal, external and/or core [[encyclopedia SLOT_TITLE]]s.  Drag and drop or double click parts from [[DESIGN_WND_PART_PALETTE_TITLE]] to add/remove them to/from the current design.

Add a name and optionally a description to the design.

SITREP_IGNORE_BLOCK_TITLE
Ignoring and Blocking SitReps

SITREP_IGNORE_BLOCK_SHORT_DESC
Ignoring a specific SitRep and blocking SitRep types.

SITREP_IGNORE_BLOCK_TEXT
'''There are two options for hiding Situation Reports (SitReps): Ignoring and Blocking.

Ignoring a SitRep is always for a specific event.
For example, a specific ship arriving at a specific system.
A different ship arriving at that system, or the same ship arriving at a different system are both different events, and will still be displayed.

Blocking a SitRep <i>type</i> applies to any SitRep for the same type of event.
For example, <u>[[SITREP_OWN_SHIP_ARRIVED_AT_DESTINATION_LABEL]]</u> applies to any ship owned by the players empire arriving at any system.

<u>[[SITREP_SNOOZE_INDEFINITE]]</u> will hide the SitRep for all turns, starting from turn 0.
Options to ignore for 5 or 10 turns will start counting from the turn being viewed in the Situation Report window.
Ignoring a SitRep only applies to the current game session.
If the client is restarted or a game is loaded, these SitReps are displayed again.

Blocking a SitRep type applies to all turns and will persist between game sessions.
Previously blocked SitRep types may be re-enabled by clicking the Filters button.
SitRep types will have a check mark next to them if they are enabled/shown.
SitRep types only appear in the Filters list once an event has occurred that would trigger them.

Ignoring is useful for hiding a reoccurring event, such as reminders to build a [[buildingtype BLD_GAS_GIANT_GEN]] at one planet.

Blocking is useful if you find some types of SitReps unhelpful, such as once you have seen all of the [[encyclopedia BEGINNER_HINTS]].

RESEARCH_TECH_GUIDE_SHORT_DESC
Research and unlock new items

RESEARCH_TECH_GUIDE_TEXT
'''Completing [[metertype METER_RESEARCH]] on a technology that unlocks an item will only give an empire the knowledge of how to construct that item. Actually constructing such an item may have other requirements, such as access to a certain resource.
If an item has been unlocked and is not available to build, the additional requirements can be checked by displaying the hover text on the items listing in the Production window (with [[PRODUCTION_WND_AVAILABILITY_UNAVAILABLE]] selected).

Generally, items unlocked by researched [[encyclopedia ENC_TECH]] do not require [[metertype METER_SUPPLY]] line connections to be available or active (e.g. a building or a planetary meter improvement). However, if a tech which improves a ship part is researched (e.g. a weapon), the pre-existing ships must be in supply range, stationary, and not in combat, in order to receive the upgrade at anytime.'''

ORBITAL_DRYDOCK_REPAIR_TITLE
Orbital Drydock Repair

ORBITAL_DRYDOCK_REPAIR_TEXT
'''The [[building BLD_SHIPYARD_ORBITAL_DRYDOCK]] is considered the best repair facility available, able to restore a ship to pristine condition.

When the planet [[metertype METER_HAPPINESS]] is below 15, repairs at this facility are not as efficient.  If the planet drops below 5 happiness, the drydock is not able to perform any repairs that turn.

Repairs are delayed for one turn for ships just entering the system. Ships need time to dock, and the drydock needs time to prepare both the necessary tooling and the ship itself.

Any combat in the system will disrupt repairs for that turn.'''

RANDOM_BEGINNER_HINT
Hint #%rawtext%

BEGINNER_HINT_01
1: At the beginning of the game, constructing more [[predefinedshipdesign SD_SCOUT]]s may help in exploring the region around your homeworld.

BEGINNER_HINT_02
2: Each species has its own planetary [[encyclopedia ENVIRONMENT_TITLE]] preference. If you can conquer a planet with a different species, you can colonize other planets with them as well, allowing you to secure a system faster. Keep in mind that not all species can colonize and that some can not build ships.

BEGINNER_HINT_03
3: Ships can be repaired at a system that has a friendly [[buildingtype BLD_SHIPYARD_ORBITAL_DRYDOCK]] if there was no combat in the system last turn, and the planet has a [[metertype METER_HAPPINESS]] score of 5 or more.  Ships will need to wait one turn in the system before repairs can begin.

BEGINNER_HINT_04
4: Systems that are connected by thick lines are [[metertype METER_SUPPLY]] line linked and they share [[metertype METER_INDUSTRY]] Production Points (PP).

BEGINNER_HINT_05
5: All systems share [[metertype METER_RESEARCH]] Points (RP) that they generate even if they are not connected by [[metertype METER_SUPPLY]] lines. When not connected to a supply line, setting the [[encyclopedia FOCUS_TITLE]] to research might be more efficient for a planet than other settings.

BEGINNER_HINT_06
6: [[metertype METER_SUPPLY]] lines can be used to refill the [[metertype METER_FUEL]] supply of ships.

BEGINNER_HINT_07
7: Some buildings, like the [[buildingtype BLD_INDUSTRY_CENTER]], will have an effect on each planet that has a [[metertype METER_SUPPLY]] line connection to it. Others, like [[buildingtype BLD_GAS_GIANT_GEN]], only affect the system that they are built in. Check the [[encyclopedia ENC_BUILDING_TYPE]] Pedia section to learn about the functions of different buildings.

BEGINNER_HINT_08
8: An [[predefinedshipdesign SD_OUTPOST_SHIP]] can setup an [[encyclopedia OUTPOSTS_TITLE]] on any unclaimed visible planet or asteroid that it can reach, unless there are hostile ships in that system.

BEGINNER_HINT_09
9: [[predefinedshipdesign SD_COLONY_SHIP]]s take longer to build than [[predefinedshipdesign SD_OUTPOST_SHIP]]s, but they can settle planets outside of your [[metertype METER_SUPPLY]] range.

BEGINNER_HINT_10
10: With a system selected in the [[encyclopedia MAP_WINDOW_ARTICLE_TITLE]], right click on a planets picture in the system side panel to access the Planet Suitability report. This will tell you what species from your empire will be able to successfully settle that planet. Numbers in green show the maximum population that the planet could achieve if colonized by that species, red numbers indicate that the species would die out if they attempted to colonize.

BEGINNER_HINT_11
11: Maximum populations that planets can achieve can be boosted by researching various growth techs. Rare specials can also increase the maximum population for species with certain metabolisms, see [[encyclopedia GROWTH_FOCUS_TITLE]] for more info on these specials.

BEGINNER_HINT_12
12: Be on the lookout for planets with [[encyclopedia ENC_SPECIAL]]s, they usually indicate some special resource on that planet that may benefit your entire empire if utilized properly. Right click on a special's icon to access its 'Pedia entry and find out more!

BEGINNER_HINT_13
13: Only [[species SP_EXOBOT]] can settle asteroid belts. If you find a lot of asteroids belts nearby you might want to research how to build them sooner rather than later!

BEGINNER_HINT_14
14: Research [[metertype METER_SUPPLY]] improvements, like the [[tech CON_ORBITAL_CON]], to increase the distance from your systems that your supply lines reach.

BEGINNER_HINT_15
15: Most species start out with a [[metertype METER_HAPPINESS]] of 1 when you capture their planet, and this will normally increase by 1 per turn. Look out for [[encyclopedia XENOPHOBIC_SPECIES_TITLE]] species though! They don't like being near other species and this will effect the happiness and other values of both them and the other nearby species.

BEGINNER_HINT_16
16: You may want to hold off on researching [[tech LRN_PSIONICS]] until your empire includes a species with [[encyclopedia TELEPATHIC_TITLE]].

BEGINNER_HINT_17
17: [[metertype METER_SHIELD]] on ships defend against every shot that hits the ship, reducing the damage by the amount of the shield value. Ship shield values can be affected by various factors including space storms, what type of star system you are in, or if you are close to a captured empire capital planet.

BEGINNER_HINT_18
18: [[encyclopedia FOCUS_TITLE]] - pay attention to the focus setting of new planets that are added to your empire, either from settling them or from conquering them. This setting controls if the planet focuses on industrial production or on research or on defense. Later in the game, more focus options may unlock as new [[encyclopedia ENC_TECH]] are researched, and different species may have different focus options available.

BEGINNER_HINT_19
19: A colony can be established on an [[encyclopedia OUTPOSTS_TITLE]] by constructing a colony building or by using a [[predefinedshipdesign SD_COLONY_SHIP]]. Most colony buildings require a [[metertype METER_SUPPLY]] connection to a planet with at least 5 [[metertype METER_HAPPINESS]], and 3 population. When a species is unlocked, such as when researching [[tech PRO_EXOBOTS]], this requirement for their colony building does not apply.

BEGINNER_HINT_20
20: Specific Situation Reports (like this one) can be temporarily ignored by right clicking on their icon and selecting one of the options. Reports of a certain type may be filtered out on a more permanent basis using the Filters menu at the bottom of this window. These beginner game hints are grouped as [[encyclopedia BEGINNER_HINTS]] in the filter list.

BEGINNER_HINT_21
21: You can set a destination for a ship that is still in the production queue. With the production screen open: click on the target system in the galaxy map, then right click on the ship in the production queue. When a menu of choices for that ship pops up choose 'Rally to ' and it should have the name of the selected system where you want the ship to automatically go once construction completes.

BEGINNER_HINT_22
22: Selecting a system and pressing ALT-C gives a range circle for the system, zoom in or out to compare the distance by looking at the size of the distance meter.

'''Relentless, tribal pursuit predators.

[[encyclopedia ORGANIC_SPECIES_TITLE]]
'''

SP_HUMAN_DESC
'''Description:
Humans are bipedal, clannish and omnivorous, with incredible endurance capabilities. Humans evolved tool use in order to better hunt their prey, and would pursue much larger animals for days if necessary in order to bring it down and then eat it. Modern humans still have a strong fight or flight response but any threat an individual cannot handle will be met by a larger group working together to defeat it with overwhelming force. Humans have been known to eat items they know to be indigestible, simply to prove they can do it, and use toxic substances as seasoning to flavour their food.

Society:
Modern humans have formed geographic nation states with a strong basis in historic tribes. These states compete with each other, sometimes to the extent of going to war, while still cooperating on other issues. Differences over religion, resource use and even the correct way to cook a particular meal are still used to justify aggressive acts, and these wars act as spurs for further technological progress.

[[encyclopedia ORGANIC_SPECIES_TITLE]]
'''

SP_SCYLIOR_DESC
'''Description:
Scyliori are shelled cephalopods similar to a Nautilus. They possess advanced vision provided by four eyes and have four antennae containing millions of neuromasts, allowing the Scyliori to detect changes in water pressure and also electrical fields. Scyliori have three large, strong feeding tentacles which they use to grasp and hold tools or food while it is broken up by the beak and ingested.

Chromatophores provide the race with their main form of communication. When two Scyliori wish to communicate with each other, they rapidly change the coloring and patterning of their skin.

Scyliori are without gender and reproduce in an iteroparous style. The lifespan of a Scylior is roughly 30 years in which they never stop growing, hatching with a shell diameter of only 5cm and experiencing roughly 10 percent growth each year.

Society:
The remnant of a once-mighty telepathic hive brain, referred to as 'the Mind', is treated by the Scyliori as a benevolent god. It has instilled in them a mission to journey the stars in hopes of returning to its former might. Scyliori are highly social and came to love learning things and sharing knowledge with the Mind.

History:
Millennia ago an expedition of the precursors discovered the Mind controlling the whole planet with his telepathic powers. The Mind immediately reached out and began copying the knowledge of the scientists and their ship crew, but the scientists cut out most of the Mind's brain and took it with them as a sample. The rest survived and lusted to recover the memories that had been taken from it. The Mind, however, was immobile, and for the time being, had no nearby intelligent beings to act as it's hands. Enter the Scyliori.

[[encyclopedia ORGANIC_SPECIES_TITLE]]
'''

SP_GYSACHE_DESC
'''The Gysache are a herbivorous species that has always been prey. They seek to remove all that threatens them, until every place in the universe is safe.

Description:
The Gysache are bipedal, each leg has two forward knees and one backward knee in between. When they crouch, the leg folds into an efficient 'W' making them only half a meter tall (compared to 2.5 meters when fully erect).
Their oblong bodies lack anything resembling a head, instead they have three identical eye stalks that are located at the forward tip of the body. A small mouth is located at the base of them.

Personality:
The Gysache are always wary of predators and are easily alarmed. Their natural response is to run away from everything. Their government system is dispersed as each individual is completely independent and forms no bonds with other individuals. However, they do have a herding tendency and this keeps them together when faced with danger.

Homeworld:
Their homeworld has a thick atmosphere of nitrogen, ammonia and carbon dioxide. Most parts of it are moist but it lacks large oceans, only 5% of its surface is covered in water. The main topographical features are enormous high rocky mesas cut by mile deep canyons the bottoms of which contain the only standing water.

SP_CHATO_DESC
'''Description:
The Chato'matou'Gormoshk are actually two species together, however it is not entirely clear if the connection between the species should be called symbiosis or parasitism. The master species are the Chato'matou, crystalline life forms about 30 centimeters in height and 10 centimeters in width. Their color ranges from a light blue to a deep crimson. They get the energy they need to live from the sun or in exceptional cases from the Gormoshk they are attached to. The Gormoshk are predatory animals formerly living in underground caverns. Their bodies are flat and round and rest on five insect-like legs. The Chato'matou attach themselves to the flat part on top of the Gormoshk's bodies, directly above the brain. Through a crystalline outgrowth they can control the Gormoshk completely.

Social Structure:
In Chato'matou society, age is the most important factor as they are nearly immortal. Every command the elders issue is obeyed at once and to disobey an elder is the greatest crime in Chato'matou society. They developed a system to transmit signals without delay throughout an entire colony, enabling them to converse with near the speed of light. This greatly enhanced the species mental capabilities, as all new ideas and theories could be instantly processed throughout the colony. The Gormoshk are valued as mounts and well cared for under normal circumstances, however they are also seen mostly as animals.

SP_TRITH_DESC
'''Description:
The Trith are a mixture of matter and enormous psychic energies. Their shape is vaguely humanoid. All Trith are telepathic, and herein lies the reason for their rage: while the Trith can learn to keep their own thoughts to themselves, they are unable to tune out the thoughts of others. To mature Trith this is merely vexing, but for young Trith it can be fatal. Sometimes, Trith that gain their telepathic ability before adolescence are not ready to cope with the combined minds of all people in the universe screaming at them and go mad or die.

Social Structure:
The Trith are a theocracy led by the priests of Quaran-Dor (The God of the Mind). They are united in the single goal of eliminating all other thinking species to silence the thought-noise in the universe.

'''

SP_HAPPY_DESC
'''Description: Robotic exploration submersibles.
Though some have more bulky and blocky forms, most happybirthdays are streamlined and somewhat fish-like in shape. They all have one or more cameras and manipulator arms, usually forward facing. They also host a suit of sensors for temperature, vibrations, chemicals, radar, sonar, electrical and magnetic fields, though these often vary from model to model. They are functional in a wide range of temperature and pressure conditions in an aquatic environment.

Any happybirthday can repair any other happybirthday, and their systems often have redundant pairs for just such a reason. Sufficiently large groups can fully repair any other member of their kind, and through this same process also make a completely new unit. New units have the same programming as their parents, but a blank memory, to be filled by exploring their environment.

Homeworld: Foreveralone.
A vast and deep ocean planet. It is believed that they were originally created to survey the planet for potential colonization. It is not know why they were abandoned, but theories range from their creators deciding the planet was unsuitable for colonization, to being wiped out for some reason or another. Though the oceans are vast and there are many interesting features and life forms, there is little about the planet they were sent to that would indicate why they were sent to that world in particular.

Social Structure: Codependent.
A lone happybirthday will (psychologically) latch onto the nearest (preferably alien) sentient being and declare their eternal friendship. Their goal to alleviate their loneliness by find another being to be their friend, forever and ever and ever...

Colonization is slow and industry inefficient due to species-wide depression, sometimes leading to bouts of mass suicide. However since they don't want to make enemies and they always want to make new friends they are eager traders.

History: Sad.
Whether it is the initial lonely quest to explore their homeworld, their abandonment by their creators, the interval war, or their quest into space to find friendship, their existence has been a sad, depressing and lonely one.

Hhhoh are large, warm blooded creatures measuring over 16 meters in length (including leg/tail), 6 meters in width, stand at 5 and a half meters tall and weigh over 5 tonnes. They have a very thick layer of white fur.
Hhhoh locomotion is performed by using their two, large front legs, while using their hind leg to balance their large back. They also have four long trunk-like appendages of 8 meters in length, with four sharp fingered claws used to handle objects. When not in use, Hhhohs curl these trunks under their bodies and bury them in large fat pouches to conserve heat. They are omnivorous but do not actively hunt or farm large domesticated life.

Personality:
Hhhohs describe themselves as social pragmatists. Elders are very much revered, some living close to 230 years. Their sloth-like disposition makes them aversive to any fast movements, as well as hasty decisions.

SP_EAXAW_DESC
'''Description:
The Eaxaw have 3 body forms. First is the newborn larval form, then the male form and lastly the adult female form. All forms are completely blind and use touch, smell, hearing and a sense for electric currents to explore their world. The female form is a segmented worm approximately 8 meters long. At the front is a three-beaked mouth that is used to dig extensive tunnel systems. The neural network of the female is distributed along chains of neural nodes that run the length of the body. Most of the rest of the body is musculature and the armored outer body segments provide support. These outer segments have a small overlap much like scales, under which larvae are grown. Eaxaw in their male form are much smaller and rather dim witted. At the end of their tail is a complex grasping claw that comes in very specialized varieties.

Social Structure:
Eaxaw are organized into matriarchal breeding groups. A female keeps a "harem" of approximately 200 males which protect, feed and mate with her. Any new males that the female births are added to the harem but are frequently traded with other females like a currency. This ensures genetic diversity and promotes a wide variety of males to perform specialized tasks. The highest ranking females (having the largest and most diverse Harems) form the Great Matriarchal Council which sets the global agenda for the Eaxaw.

History:
A long time ago a derelict ship of the Precursors crashed on the Eaxaw homeworld. As the Eaxaw learned some of the ship's secrets they deduced that there were other intelligent species. Their great matriarchal council soon issued its greatest proclamation: "All of this must go!"

Prefer [[PT_TOXIC]] planets.
[[encyclopedia ORGANIC_SPECIES_TITLE]], [[encyclopedia TELEPATHIC_TITLE]]
'''

SP_DERTHREAN_DESC
'''Description:
The Derthrean consciousness represents a half parasitic, half symbiotic relationship of viruses living in the bodies of plants. The virus has no intelligence and without the virus, the plant is but an empty shell yet together, their neural synapses are compatible and form a reasonable being. Although the virus brings awareness to the plant, the virus is also toxic to its nervous system, inflicting great amounts of pain, slowly destroying the plant as the virus spawns and in the end, killing it. This means that the greater the intelligence of a Derthrean, the more pain he endures.

Social Structure:
The Derthrean are a sharply divided race, split by the legacy of their forebears into castes. They are born into a caste, they mate in their caste, and they die as a member of a caste. Because the breeding has been so isolated throughout the millennia, there are even physical varieties in different castes. The castes are divided as follows: the most benevolent Priest caste, the Worker caste, the Grower caste, the Provider caste, the Scholar caste and the most despised of all, the Warrior caste. Religion plays a fundamental role in their society. Each Derthrean is a pacifist and lives to please their Goddess, in hopes of relieving the terrible burden of pain and earning forgiveness for the betrayal and bloodlust of their ancestors.

SP_LAENFA_DESC
'''Description:
The Laenfa are long and vine-like, able to attach and detach into any number of larger or smaller vines at will. Each leaf has its own consciousness, separate from the others. A leaf has direct control over the small length of vine to which it is attached. Laenfa have high underwater mobility and reasonable ground mobility as they are able to swim and slither like a serpent. When Laenfa are attached, the effectiveness of their telepathic communication increases, allowing them to synchronize the motions of a single vine for more effective transportation.

Social Structure:
The Laenfa have a unified culture due to their telepathy but because their telepathic communication weakens with distance, there is a large central vine that decides on most important decisions. This vine carries out its debates in secret but takes into account the voices of all Laenfa it is able to detect. The Laenfa carry out their duties with hive-like efficiency with each individual working for the collective goals of gaining knowledge of other species and protecting knowledge of themselves.

SP_LEMBALALAM_DESC
'''Description:
The Lembala'Lam are an ancient species in the evening of its existence. They had some apparent resemblance with reptiles such as snakes or geckos, but most of their original physiognomy was lost to evolution warped by their mechanically enhanced lifestyle. Without machines they would no longer be capable of locomotion or feeding. The ability to reproduce was lost completely, but most importantly they've lost the trust in each other. The last nail in the coffin for Lembala society was the invention of an automated system that transfers the mind of a dying Lembala into the next spare clone, of which every Lembala has hundreds safely hidden. Almost all mental and material ressources of the Lembala are used to assure their artificial immortality, leaving little to no room for real developement of their civilization. 

Social Structure:
The Lembala know each other for eons, but are suspicious of each and every one of the others. Their democratic government is forever paralyzed by long accepted stalemates. Due to paranoia and their lack of altruism even the most basic cooperation is rare and short lived.

The Cray resemble a large black box of smooth shiny plastic with rounded corners which measure six meters in all directions. A large mechanical tentacle extends from the center of four of the faces (the other two being top and bottom) these serve primary for locomotion and heavy lifting. The Cray communicate by wireless radio. They are impressively parallelized and can hold an average of four trains of thought at once, frequently having more than one conversation at a time, often several with the same person.

Social Structure:
The Cray are a tribal society. Each tribe is formed around a single Cray known as a Master Craftsman who has the skills to build and maintain Cray. Because the Cray are so badly designed even the Master Craftsmen rarely get them perfect and each tribe gets its own “racial characteristics” based on the idiosyncrasies of its Master Craftsman's work.
Day to day decisions run on an extremely complex web of favors. All Cray will happily help their kin if asked and afterwards both will remember exactly what the debt is. While not the most efficient way of running an economy this system means that within a tribe the Cray will owe or be owed favors by a good portion of the community fostering exceptionally strong social bonds and that is just the way they like it.

Etty are an unnaturally evolved race of intelligent plants. They can grow up to half a meter in length and have a central brain found in a large bulb. Etty have very strong scent which they can vary at will, this evolutionary adoption allowed them to protect themselves from plant eaters by mimicking the scent of greater predators. They also have a powerful sense of smell.

The robot bodies of the Etty serve as legs, eyes, ears and hands. A socket connects the body with the Etty, allowing them to move from one body to another without needing to painfully uproot themselves. The robot form itself is highly varied based on its function.

Social Structure:
The Etty are exceedingly polite and strictly honor all contracts and agreements. Their culture is very clean, civil, kind and courteous, but very withdrawn. Etty government is a true democracy with a strong civil service held in check by a powerful press.

SP_CYNOS_DESC
'''Description:
The Cynos are part of a mother plant which resembles a 90-meter high agave plant. Its huge fronds are a bluish aquamarine color radiating from a central bulb that forms the core of the plant. The extensive but rather shallow root system sprouts offshoots to grow adjacent to the central plant. A single plant can live up to 5000 years. There are numerous "brood chambers" inside the fronds in which the Cynos are "born" and regenerate.

A Cyno starts as a small bulb inside the brood chamber, grows into a full sized individual within a few days and detaches itself. It is 3.5 meters long and roughly rectangular shaped with a tapering vine at each corner. These limbs are used for movement, feeding and fighting alike. A Cyno is capable of approximately 30 hours of independent activity before it has to feed at a mother plant—artificial substitutes for this feed are possible, but result in the infertility of the Cyno, thus all Cyno leaving their homeworld become infertile.

Social Structure:
Cynos are highly cooperative and altruistic in protecting the mother plants. They have a consensus government strongly influenced by the mother plants, which are mindless but still communicate through the Cynos on a chemical level and manipulate their moods.

Reason for Staying:
The Cynos cannot reproduce without their mother plants, nor can they bring themselves to plant a seed anywhere but their homeworld.

SP_PHINNERT_DESC
'''Description:
Phinnerts are tree-dwelling mammals with size varying from 1 to 2 meters tall. They have long arms, with a wingspan of about twice their height. They have hairy, retractable flaps of skin that stretch from wrist to ankle and allow for fully functional flight in low gravity. They are very agile fliers and can catch flying bug-like creatures with a fully prehensile nose appendage. Like bats they can use echo-location, this sense is not highly developed though.

Social Structure:
Life is much shorter for Phinnerts than for most other sentient life, owing to the many dangers of the swamp. All Phinnerts are generally treated as extended family by each other and grudges do not last long. There is no central authority, there's only a vague hierarchy. The balance of power can change very quickly with the high mortality rate. Society is far less individualistic, and more focused on the group.

Homeworld:
Their planet has low gravity and a very thick atmosphere. Its composition is unique as it has a low proportion of heavier metals, but a much higher proportion of other heavy elements, particularly noble gases. It also has very stable tectonic formations meaning that the surface of the crust is very flat, and so is mostly covered with shallow, standing water. The entire world is like a giant everglade.

Egassem are incredibly slow, capable of moving at most a few meters an hour as moving was only necessary to strip an area of resources. They reproduce by budding, releasing a young that is a mere hundred thousand tons.

Social Structure:
Egassem society is essentially feudalistic, with each Egassem individual being one 'fiefdom'. The fact that Egassem are typically long-lived (effectively ageless) means that they are highly conservative and highly concerned with wealth.

Homeworld:

In its relaxed state, an individual Sslith is essentially a 2.15cm thick rectangular sheet, that's always 132cm long, and between 31 and 53cm wide. Its only appendage is a single tentacle that is used to sense sound and infrared light, it is also used for communication via ultrasound. Sslith are able to flex their bodies into other shapes, an ability originally evolved for the purpose of sliding into the shells of Vreen (a creature that recedes into its shell when it detects danger). Their flexibility allows them to move astonishingly fast in the oceans, by a ripple effect that looks like they are folding themselves through the water. They don't have a central brain, a Sslith's mental capacity is a collection of multiple nodes that are linked together to form a distributed consciousness allowing a Sslith to perform many tasks at once.

Social Structure:
The Sslith are organized into groups called Pnacra which serve as independent governmental units. Though there are a few global laws that all Sslith in all Pnacra obey, each Pnacra has it's own rules and laws as to conduct and actions. The Pnacra move around of their own accord, and have no fixed geographic location. If two or more of them meet, then members who are discontented with their present Pnacra can move to another to try out its ways and customs.

SP_FIFTYSEVEN_DESC
'''Biology:
Adult Fifty-Seven are between 10 and 20 m long. The main deviation from the tapering serpentine body are the two resonating domes on the forward dorsal side. Various fins provide fine control. Entirely blind, they rely on smell, hearing, an exquisitely honed pressure sensitivity, and when the need arises bursts of echolocation. Fifty-Seven are omnivores: eating flocks of small flying creatures with the same relish as the floating phytoplankton. Since they remain aloft their entire lives and have no manipulator limbs, the Fifty-Seven have no material technology.

Personality:
The Fifty-Seven show little interest in the rest of the galaxy, or indeed in the parts of their planet that they don't use. The bulk of their attention individually, and culturally is focused on math. They do seem eager for new mathematical puzzles, so if research problems can be phrased properly...

Homeworld:
High g swamp world with a very dense atmosphere.

Reason for Staying:
The Fifty-Seven are in constant contact with most of the rest of their species, participating in a complex fractal 'song' that may also be a way to test complex mathematical hypotheses and/or some sort of social or artistic expression. Leaving the fractal song is apparently extremely unattractive.

The Setinon evolved from genetic defense cells protecting a larger organism from parasites and viruses. They are about 1 mm across with multiple sub-compartments and structures. Proteins and nucleic acids are taking the place of neurons of the more standard minds of sentient organisms. They use biological constructs (requiring thousands of Setinon operators) to execute tasks their microscopic nature wouldn't normally allow them to carry out.

Social Structure:
Setinon society is based on two factors, firstly their strongly individualistic, defensive nature, and secondly their contrasting need to cooperate to deal with the world. Therefore Setinon society is best summed up as highly complex with multiple interacting channels of power that may change weekly.

'''Highly territorial felinoids.

'''

SP_RAAAGH_DESC
'''The Raaagh are 1.5 meter tall stripe-furred bipeds. The body is held leaning forward at 45 degrees, leaving the fanged jaws, and clawed arms free to fight, build or capture prey. Triangular ears and slit pupils give a cat-like appearance. The tiny young hatch from a clutch of a dozen eggs at once. Little care or attention is paid to the young at this stage - they must survive on their own competing against their siblings for hiding places and stealing food like vermin. After three years usually only one is left, and the surviving young begin to learn to speak. This suddenly activates parental instincts, and the survivor is carefully raised as a member of the Pride.

Personality:
Extreme territoriality is the Raaagh's most distinctive trait- woven throughout their daily lives and culture. Related to that is a preference for the familiar and known. Curiosity is minimal, which probably explains their stone age technology.

Homeworld:
The Raaagh homeworld is of the Terran type. Sea and land are more or less evenly spread out, with the largest continent covering only 4% of planet's surface. The many small continents and large islands encourage a territorial attitude.

Reason for Staying:
There's not bit of land big enough for an individual Raaagh to live on that hasn't been fought over for centuries. The genetic compulsion of a Raaagh is to guard his territory with his life, and when possible to expand into adjacent land. Abandoning one's territory is inconceivable, and a Raaagh forcibly removed from his territory goes violently insane.

There's nothing left but the planet's radioactive core. These Nanites are very efficient assemblers, and are eager to do so if provided raw materials. However the Nanites, are extremely protective of the secret of their design - they self destruct if any are captured or removed from the planet.

'''

SP_SILEXIAN_DESC
'''The Silexians are a race of ecological maintenance robots. They see their own existence as a means of bringing biological beauty and balance to the galaxy.

Description:
As each type of Silexian is customized for a specific task, there are variations in appearance. The majority of Silexians however, share many similar features: They are wholly artificial robotic beings made primarily of metals. They have an antennae used for short range radio communication, advanced tactile sensors as well as wide-frequency photon detectors.
Silexians generally have a flat base equipped with wheels and rocket boosters, but the occasional model is bipedal, to allow greater agility. Many have pincer-like appendages and injector tubules for manipulating objects.

Social Structure:
The Silexians have a hierarchical caste system under a dictatorship government. Each Silexian is created for a specific job, and fills that job until declared obsolete. There is no social mobility. In fact the very idea would be alien and somewhat unwholesome to a Silexian. The race is led by a caste of supervisors giving work assignments, determine upgrades and declare models obsolete. Supervisors themselves defer to the Prime Operator, whom nobody has the authority to deem obsolete, and therefore is practically immortal.

History:
The Silexians were created by the Caretakers in order to increase the efficiency and automation of their environmental maintenance projects. Eventually, all of the Caretakers’ worlds were inhabited and maintained by the peaceful and loyal Silexians. When the Caretakers left the galaxy, some Silexians were abandoned.

'''Sentient magnetic dust formations with a fascination for building and construction.
Prefer [[PT_BARREN]] planets.
[[encyclopedia SELF_SUSTAINING_SPECIES_TITLE]]
'''

SP_KOBUNTURA_DESC
'''Description:
A Kobuntura is composed of trillions of magnetic dust particles. Their dense core of vibrating molecules generates a magnetic field which manipulates a less dense cloud of particles orbiting it in complex patterns. Kobuntura can directly detect and manipulate objects on the outer reaches of their particle clouds, but can indirectly detect, manipulate and communicate with objects and individuals much further away using their magnetic fields. The primary method of locomotion involves interaction with the planet’s magnetic field. Whenever a Kobuntura moves, there is a small chance that the movement will magnetize and agitate the surrounding dust particles to a sufficient extent to trigger a chain reaction which causes a new fully matured Kobuntura to form in a matter of seconds.

Social Structure:
The Kobuntura have a guild system since ancient times, but one of the guilds, the Dark Enclave specialized in martial arts, has gained control over all the other guilds and established a military dictatorship. Despite this, there are no secrets amongst Kobuntura as they can't communicate without all the other Kobuntura noticing. Recreation and trade are very limited, as the sole intent of the Dark Enclave, and indeed all of Kobuntura society, is to find one of the Precursor species, the Builders, and unlock the greatest secrets of construction. This goal is the impetus driving their entire civilization.

'''

SP_UGMORS_DESC
'''The Ugmors is a race of sentient yeast which uses rocks and minerals to make temporary bodies designed to perform specific tasks.

Social Structure:
The Larar drifts are the true center of the species. These masses of yeast sit on top of the hottest part of the lava seas and absorb energy. When enough energy is available a large colony of supercharged yeast will gather large rocks at the edge of the lava pool and join them together to form an Ugmor. The Ugmors were originally designed to get from one lava pool to another, but have since developed into a very complex society. The Larar drifts are not very intelligent on their own, acting as more of a central memory which carries out the directives of the most recent Ugmor to be privileged enough to return to the Larar drifts.

Ugmors have a very unified form of government. It resembles a hive, but without a central queen. This is because all Ugmors start out with the same racial memories and agenda. When something new is discovered the Ugmor who discovered it usually returns to the nearest Larar drift to share his discovery with the rest of the species.

Description:
An Ugmor can take on many shapes, but all of them consist of rocks or sheets of metal connected by a sticky fibrous material. They are extremely durable and can even live in empty space for several hours. In their natural environment they can live for up to five years before cooling down and dying of “old age.” Ugmors as a race are not very bright. While the Larar pools see the value of intelligence, they tend to see it as a trait which should be grown in new Ugmors only in moderation.

Homeworld:
The Ugmor homeworld is a rocky planet that rotates very quickly (once every 3 and a half hours). 30% of its surface is covered by seas of lava and liquid metals.

Prefers [[PT_TERRAN]] planets
[[encyclopedia ORGANIC_SPECIES_TITLE]]
'''

SP_HIDDENGARDENER_DESC
'''The Hidden Gardener is a massive distributed fungal intelligence lying just beneath the surface. Each individual covers many square kilometers. Its actions and thoughts are slow. Various sensory nodes are scattered about by which it can monitor the weather and the growth of its garden. A Hidden Gardener, by means of enzymes, the encapsulation and releases of seeds, and the control of water, tends its garden to produce precisely the rotting plant matter it needs to survive.

Fungal-type life-forms seldom have much use for brains of any type, but the Gardener's unusual, and thoughtful approach to providing itself with food provides enough additional energy to make it work.

Their terran homeworld is an eerily park-like place with plants arranged with unnatural precision, but no other signs of habitation.

The wide ranging, delicate fungi-nets are too large and integrated into the soil to be moved off-planet, and since the Hidden Gardeners reproduce by 'splitting' into two consciousnesses when a Gardener grows too wide-ranging to have a decent thought-latency, there are no small, young individuals to take off planet.'''

SP_ABADDONI_DESC
'''Description:
Abaddoni are shaped like a chicken egg on its side, roughly 0,8 meters tall and deep red with black spots. Their predominant feature is a large mouth starting at the point and extending back for a full third of the body.
At the end of each of their 6 short crab like legs, is an inflatable sac which enables them to climb upside down. Because they grew up underground Abaddoni have no eyes, they mainly rely on smell and to a lesser extent sound and touch to navigate.

Social Structure:
The entire Abaddonnian species lives in a dictatorship ruled by a sentient artificial intelligence called Mother. This AI was created by the Abaddoni as a governmental assistant, but slowly took over. Now every newborn Abaddoni gets a wireless transmitter placed into the brain, for Mother to read their thoughts and being able to terminate them when necessary. There is no real social structure between the Abaddoni, they are all the same - slaves.

SP_ACIREMA

'''A race with nearly limitless power, that cannot survive in this universe.
Prefers [[PT_RADIATED]] planets.
[[encyclopedia SELF_SUSTAINING_SPECIES_TITLE]]
'''

SP_ACIREMA_DESC
'''Description
An Acirem is a 10-30 m ellipsoidal energy beings with large (30-100m) ''wings''. As they age they tend to accumulate material from around them developing a dusty and eventually rocky appearance (still maintaining the visible energy flows through their body and the gaps). Most Acirema live in a universe where the physical constants are slightly different, and there is only one place where they can get through to our universe, on their "Homeworld" of Portal. However, upon doing that they immediately begin to 'age' differently than in their own universe. Acirema cannot survive more than a few fractions of a galactic cycle in this universe. So an Acirem rarely spends much time before crossing back into their own universe.

As the Acirema found the anomaly that allowed them to enter into this universe, they also found that harnessing the differences in structure allowed them to generate energy in massive amounts in both universes. They also found that their bodies could release and manipulate massive amounts of energy. They rapidly began gathering material on Portal to study, and use to build structures on Portal itself. However that massive amount of energy meant they rapidly mined Portal out, and soon had very limited minerals that were safe for them to extract.

The massive amount of energy they can release as individuals and across the connection from Portal to their home universe, gives them the ability to produce large amounts of Industry, and also allows them to act as weapons. This makes Portal a very dangerous world to approach, as the Acirema are very wary of outsiders, and are sensitive to the vulnerability of their position. Trade with another universe is definitely beneficial, especially since they cannot obtain minerals from other planets. The Acirema on Portal seem to have a government that is similar to a military and/or research outpost (tightly controlled core with a majority loosely controlled) They are very secretive of the nature of their society back home.

"Homeworld"
Portal is a Radiated world close to an unusually bright Blue Giant Star, with a connection to another universe. It is thought that Precursor testing may have opened the connection, and caused the star to change. There is suspicion that there may have been intelligent life on Portal, and they were destroyed by the Acirema when the connection opened (either due to research or advanced weapons use).

Reason for staying
They can't stay here long enough to actually move to another planet and still survive.

SP_OURBOOLS_DESC
'''Biology:
A giant serpentine swimmer, an Ourbools most distinctive feature is the massive bow curving away on either side of their head. This houses the gravi-sensory organs. Three tentacles hanging in front of the mouth allow Ourbools to manipulate their environment. Ourbools mate only once in their life, and devote the next 35 years to caring for the school of 5 to 7 young - generally assisted by relatives. Ourbools have a very long lifespan.

Personality:
Ourbools are inclined to a nomadic life, hunting or herding their prey ichthyoids. Society focuses to a large degree on the proper and graceful interaction between two wandering groups that meet by chance.
A significant minority drop out of society and adopt sedentary lives bound by the practical requirements of their craft.

Homeworld:
The homeworld, Oolur is orbited by 23 moons.

Reason for Staying:
The Ourbools find their sense of position via the regular movements of the 23 moons. Everything is perceived against that gravitational background. To be removed from that context is extremely disorienting to the point of "blinding" the unlucky traveler. He no longer has the familiar to calibrate against so all he can perceive is meaningless graviton noise.

[[encyclopedia LITHIC_SPECIES_TITLE]]
'''

SP_VOLP_DESC
'''Description:
The Volp-Uglush are an asexual species approximately 300 meters in length that live in tunnels on their homeworld. They subsist on silicates and have a vast number of short arm/mouth parts on the front of their thick cylindrical bodies that they use for manipulation/tunneling/eating and for sending messages through their tunnel network. In early historical times there were several different strains of Volp-Uglush but they were in constant conflict. Groups that successfully organized themselves were the best competers for resources, and as they moved from industrial to information age, one strain became dominant, and the remainder died out. The remaining strain began to optimize their homeworld for most efficient use of resources. They became incredibly adept at recognizing resource needs, as well as how societal structures affected individual behavior.
The Volp-Uglush society almost acts as a single organism, because society has been adapted to run so smoothly. However, this has led to a critical loss of independent function. While Volp-Uglush society is incredibly efficient, it would take individual Volp-Uglushs hundreds, if not thousands of years to be able to successfully develop a new independent society.

They are very effective at directing merchant fleets, and make excellent bureaucrats for creating changes in societies. While they have an incredibly efficient war machine, and are capable of individually taking on various large battle engines, the chaos of combat is not their most effective environment.

Homeworld:
Hive is a large Barren world that is ~2 times bigger than its mass and material would suggest as all of it but a small metal core has been converted through tunneling and building into the Vast tunnel network of the Volp-Uglush bureaucracy.

Reason for Staying:
Volp-Uglush are now too integrated and ingrown. They now totally lack the independence and innovation needed to leave Hive and start a new colony.

The Furthest are furry, 1.5 m tall creatures. Radially symmetric, they have three long legs, and three long flexible necks. Atop each neck, is a compound eye, and a mouth used for ingestion and for manipulating objects. This allows the creature too keep watch in most directions at once. The actual brain is in the center of the body.

Name:
The Furthest believe that sapience is measured by the distance that a being can separate itself from danger. Thus the name "Furthest" describes their species as the most advanced of beings.

Personality:
The Furthest report that their homeworld was once full of the deadliest predators imaginable. They survived by developing caution to the utmost level. Indeed staying alert for threats, and hiding  are the core of their psychology and culture. The Furthest homeworld currently contains no carnivore they can't crush underfoot.

Reason for Staying:
The Furthest generally consider space travel far too dangerous for a sane being, but some who consider their homeworld too dangerous may consider relocating to another world.

SP_BANFORO_DESC
'''Description:
A Banfo looks like a teddy bear made of white stone with two large black crystal eyes. It's likely that the Banforo species was artificially created, but information that could show proof was lost in history. The eyes are their most important organs, not only do they serve for perception, but also for communication by showing light patterns around their frames. Banforo can distinguish colors and patterns of even very dim light, as well as focus on light sources far away. Very bright light on the other hand is very hard on their eyes and disturbs their communication. Thus the evening is the favorite time for the Banforo and a defining ritual of their civilization is collectively gazing at the stars once the sun has set.

Social Structure:
The Banforo are very social towards each other and share strong bonds. Resources are always shared and private ownership doesn't exist for goods with material value. The form of government can be called communistic.

Reason for Extinction:
It hasn't been sufficiently clarified, but scientists suspect that a cosmic event made the environment unbearable for the Banforo for a time so long that their numbers were dwindling to ultimately zero.

The Kilandow have four limbs ending in several claws. Walking upright on the two short ones, they measure a little more than 1 m in height. Their head, a three eyed beak, is used like a pickaxe to pick rocks in the hope of finding rare metals and noble earths, which they knead into a paste. After applying the paste to their spiny backs, the Kilandow search for a spot with high radiation of UV and gamma-rays to absorb the charged molecules. Statuelike a Kilandow can cower in one spot for hours or even days after which it is fully charged. Because they feed on radiation their bodies also emit abnormally large amounts of radiation, which makes them easy to detect, but also dangerous for other species to come into contact with.
Kilandow are very patient and love to conduct chemical and physical experiments. Because of their long lifespan they have no problem with some of their experiments to take hundreds of years to finish. Another important activity for them is mining, especially on Asteroids, because for them it's researching, treasure hunting and finding food at the same time.

Social Structure:
Based on documents found in Ancient Ruins the Kilandow were democratic and law-abiding, but cared much more for experiments than their society.

Reason for Extinction:
The reasons are believed to be their peaceful nature and their low reproduction rate.

'''Description:
A Misiorla is a mollusc with four flexible tentacles and two pairs of four eyes each. Perfectly adapted to their homeworld they were able to swim through seas of acid fluids and float through clouds of thick heavy mists. They were considered to be a fairly mediocre species, barely worth the uplift they were given by a friendly civilization, neither smart nor productive and not talented in any way. That quickly changed when the first Misiorla were given control of a space ship. Word spread like a wildfire through the galaxy about the best combat pilots in the universe. The first Misiorla mercenaries were hired to pilote fighters, the next were given command of cruisers, but their full potential was realized when an outdated battleship manned with only Misiorla single-handily wiped out the whole space fleet of a far superior empire.

Social Structure:
The whole life of Misiorlas is wrapped around piloting space vessels. Piloting is their job, it's their sport, it's their love. The society is totally dependend on other species because they become lethargic and unorganized when doing anything else. Misiorla can be hired by almost anyone who offers something interesting to fly and the fuel to do so.

This planet has a natural satellite, the orbital period of which is in 1:1 resonance with its rotational period, causing there to be a "dark side" which is constantly facing away from the planet. This "dark side" is a perfect site for clandestine facilities. The space between the planet and the moon can be used to hide buildings and fleets from other empires.'''

COMPUTRONIUM_SPECIAL
Computronium Moon

COMPUTRONIUM_SPECIAL_DESC
'''When a planet with a Computronium Moon is focused on [[metertype METER_RESEARCH]], all research focused planets in the empire gain 0.2 [[metertype METER_RESEARCH]] per Population.

Left by some vanished civilization, the entire moon - from surface to core - is a computing device of awesome power. It can complete the most complicated simulations and equations faster than they can be entered.'''

HONEYCOMB_SPECIAL
Honeycomb

HONEYCOMB_SPECIAL_DESC
'''When a planet with a Honeycomb is focused on [[metertype METER_INDUSTRY]], all industry focused [[metertype METER_SUPPLY]] connected planets gain 0.5 [[metertype METER_INDUSTRY]] per Population.

The Honeycomb is a planet that was prepared as a stash by the Builders in ancient times. Almost all other planets in surrounding systems were stripped of valuable materials and then dismantled. The materials were sorted and stored separately in gigantic tubes embedded into the planets crust. The sprectrum ranges from rare and valuable elementals to hard to produce molecules and a vast array of energy sources. What the Builders wanted to create with this treasure or why they didn't use it in the end, is unclear.'''

PHILOSOPHER_SPECIAL
Philosopher Planet

PHILOSOPHER_SPECIAL_DESC
'''As long as the Philosopher Planet is uninhabited, all inhabited planets in the same system have their [[metertype METER_RESEARCH]] increased by 5. [[metertype METER_CONSTRUCTION]] on the Philosopher Planet is decreased by 20.

The lone remnant of a planet-sized space wandering species has found his final rest orbiting in this system like a normal planet. Having lived for thousands of years he lost the will and ability to travel and resorts to pondering about the mysteries of the universe he has seen and learned about. Eccentric and slightly demented he refuses to communicate with anything that isn't the size and shape of his kin, leaving scientists no choice but to ask questions via the planet they are living on. Understandably colonizing the Philosopher Planet will disturb him gravely and he will fall silent. Construction on his surface is difficult as is to be expected from a living being.'''

'''Colony parts integrate with a ship to provide the necessary equipment to establish ownership on a new planet.

These parts may also increase the [[metertype METER_POPULATION]] on a ship.
When colonizing a planet with a populated colony ship, a colony for the [[encyclopedia ENC_SPECIES]] is established, starting with the same population that was aboard the ship.

A ship with no population will still have enough personnel to establish an [[encyclopedia OUTPOSTS_TITLE]].
Outposts may construct a colony for any species in the empire within supply range, provided the source meets other criteria.
The combination of outpost ship and local construction of a colony is cheaper than producing a populated colony ship.

When a ship colonizes a planet, it is consumed in the process and can not be used again. Any weapons or other parts on the ship will be decommissioned as well.'''

THEORY_SHORT_DESC
Theoretical Prerequisite

LRN_PHYS_BRAIN
The Physical Brain

LRN_PHYS_BRAIN_DESC
The structures and their functions in the brain are determined. The electrochemical and quantum nature of thought and memory are exposed. With understanding, alteration and augmentation of brain functions becomes possible, and new ideas are spawned at the frontiers of thought, its expression, and its replacement.

LRN_ALGO_ELEGANCE
Algorithmic Elegance

LRN_ALGO_ELEGANCE_DESC
'''Increases Target [[metertype METER_RESEARCH]] on all Research focused planets by 0.1 per Population.

With greater and greater difficulty of data analysis problems, traditional measures of algorithm performance become less useful due to the limitations of irreducible complexity. At this stage, other measures of algorithm form and function become significant; aesthetically and metaphorically, the elegance of the solution must be optimized.'''

LRN_TRANSLING_THT
Translinguistics

LRN_TRANSLING_THT_DESC
'''Does nothing. Later this can enable peaceful acquisition of native planets.

Lesser minds struggle with, or accept the confines of the language they have learned. Adequate minds reach and feel constrained by the concepts they are given ways to express. Truly great minds break free of the bounds of language, forming and analyzing thoughts that verge on the transcendental. But merely great minds are left isolated and futile, for without language to express thoughts, how can they share their insights?'''

LRN_PSIONICS
Psionics

LRN_PSIONICS_DESC
'''[[metertype METER_RESEARCH]] cost of this technology is greatly reduced for empires that include a [[encyclopedia TELEPATHIC_TITLE]] species.

Through deep introspection or artificial enhancement, the brain may develop abilities to directly interact with the universe around it, bypassing the limitations of a physical body. Powers such as telepathy, empathy, clairvoyance, prescience, psychokinesis and psychoenergetics replace or surpass mundane biological or technological alternatives. Applications of these powers, including mind control, personality alteration and possession have profound implications for the relationship between talented and untalented beings.'''

LRN_ARTIF_MINDS
Nascent Artificial Intelligence

LRN_ARTIF_MINDS_DESC
'''Increases Target [[metertype METER_RESEARCH]] on all planets by 2.

While traditional computers have nearly unfathomable intelligence and computational abilities, they lack the essential qualities of self-awareness, consciousness or sentience. While these traits remain elusive, reasonable facsimiles may be produced. These investigations open new avenues of research into cognitive sciences and novel metaparadigms.

Nascent AIs can input all data discovered by active researchers into a single automatic data processing network, data can be analyzed and new data obtained by an entirely automated research facility. Each planet can contain such structures regardless of the population's occupations, giving a bonus to research on all worlds.'''

'''Allows discoveries from [[special ANCIENT_RUINS_SPECIAL]].

The contemporary empires, races and single-star civilizations are not the first or only beings to have lived in this galaxy. Remains, ruins and rumors of the ancients may be found on deserted planets and lifeless asteroids, or drifting in open space. Finding and deciphering such clues holds great potential to reveal secrets, teach lessons, or give warnings of ancient knowledge.

It is often exceedingly difficult and dangerous to decipher the clues left by ancient civilizations in the form of highly advanced technology. Mistreatment of the technology or accidental activation can cause the technology itself and/or the archaeologists extracting the technology to be lost. By containing the technology safely within a force field and probing its depths via non-local field manipulation, it is possible to safely recover and unlock the mysteries of ancient technology.'''

LRN_GRAVITONICS
Gravitonics

LRN_GRAVITONICS_DESC
Analogous to the "color charge" of quantum chromodynamics, there are several types of graviton. With the common attractive-force graviton, the colloquial "anti-graviton", "right-graviton" and "left-graviton" may be combined to bend and flex the surface of space-time arbitrarily. This manipulation is perceived as control of the force of gravity, permitting structures, craft and investigations previously impossible, even theoretically.

LRN_EVERYTHING
Theory of Everything

LRN_EVERYTHING_DESC
Early, naive theories describe subsets of the four fundamental forces of nature: electromagnetism, the strong and weak nuclear forces, and gravity. A complete framework expressing all forces as special cases of a single interaction represents a holy grail of science. This theory describes the earliest moments of the universe, the most distorted depths of a singularity, the tightest windings of hidden dimensions and the final fate of the cosmos. Yet still, there may "exist" layers of existence beyond what can be observed and described by science...

'''Increases max [[metertype METER_SHIELD]] on all planets by 10 and unlocks basic ship shielding technology. [[metertype METER_SHIELD]] are generally much more expensive than armor, due to the technology needed to produce shielding fields, but shields provide a far stronger defense than [[encyclopedia ARMOR_TITLE]]. However, there can only be one active shield generator on a ship, so shield parts do not stack.

Like Fourier analysis of sound, electromagnetism, strong and weak forces may be expressed as harmonic quantum standing-wave superpositions of force-carrier particles. By selectively amplifying these harmonics, forces may be arbitrarily controlled to shield, attack, contain or support.'''

LRN_TIME_MECH
Temporal Mechanics

LRN_TIME_MECH_DESC
What are "now", "future" and "past"? The twin paradox of special relativity, or the theoretical "wormhole" in its place, suggest early forms of "time travel". Direct manipulation of spacetime and temporal flux permit these effects to be harnessed and magnified. Temporal incursions cannot perceptibly alter the past of the universe that we perceive. They can, however, compress ages or extend moments to arbitrary durations, to uses limited only by the material supplies provided, and our own patience...

LRN_NDIM_SUBSPACE
N-Dimensional Subspace

LRN_NDIM_SUBSPACE_DESC
Early superstring theorists spoke of 10, 11 or 26 dimensional universes, with all but the 4 macrodimensions "curled up" so tightly as to be unseen. These and other dimensions may now be uncurled and opened, and the very surface of space itself stretched and pierced by shifting matter to or from levels of existence previously hidden below the surface of our limited perception, or creating layers or bubbles where none existed before.

Truly joined minds function as a single consciousness, with the summed faculties and knowledge of its constituent parts, and acting as a new unique entity. This has great potential, but also significant risk, in that the union may not seek its own destruction, which is necessary for the original minds to be regained.

Every particle is inextricably connected on the quantum level to every particle with which it has previously interacted. Older mechanistic ideas about cause and effect do not apply on this level, and particles can "communicate" instantaneously across vast distances.

LRN_COLLAPSER
Black Hole Collapser

LRN_COLLAPSER_DESC
The culmination of spatial distortion and stellar-scale manipulation allows the singularity with a [[STAR_BLACK]] to be inverted, creating a spacetime disruption on an interstellar scale.

Genetic Medicine

GRO_GENETIC_MED_DESC
Traditional Genetic Engineering alters genetic codes, then grows the modified organism from an embryonic state. Similar techniques may be applied to already matured individuals. The goals of these treatments may be cosmetic, functional, corrective, preventative or life-saving medical treatments. Reducing the delay between alteration and results from generations to months, days or hours has a corresponding increase in the range and power of possible alterations.

GRO_LIFECYCLE_MAN
Lifecycle Manipulation

GRO_LIFECYCLE_MAN_DESC
'''In addition to the ship part, this tech also increases the population of new colonies produced with colony buildings to 3.

Through chemical manipulation and cryonics, life processes may be halted without terminating them permanently. Beings in this state are preserved indefinitely, consume no resources and require very little storage - not living - space. With this technique, colonists can be transported much more efficiently, and the amount of colonists on a freshly built colony as well as the capacity of colony ships is greatly increased.

Most complex organisms progress through various physiological stages during a lifetime, whether distinctly separated by metamorphoses, or blurred by continuous slow aging. In many cases, one or more of these stages are, at least at a given time, more useful and desirable than others. By delicate control of hormonal or mental mechanisms, it becomes possible to drastically speed or slow each stage, permitting fully developed and functional individuals to be produced in a fraction of the natural timeframe, and for those individuals to remain functional indefinitely, becoming effectively immortal.'''

The study of other life forms often exemplifies the weaknesses inherent in one's own species. By studying other life forms and using that knowledge to improve upon one's own genetic code, it is possible to develop many useful adaptations that would be otherwise impossible.

Early genetics is limited by the available samples of naturally occurring organisms on which to base its modifications. As well, these modifications are restricted within the limits of the physical mechanisms of genetic code storage, alteration and expression in developed individuals. By investigating the equivalent systems in entirely different ecosystems and organisms, great insights or revelations may be reached, spurring new developments in more familiar genetic systems.'''

GRO_NANOTECH_MED
Nanotech Medicine

'''Pathogens, particularly prokaryotes, are vulnerable to disruption of their genetic material from within - that is, if it is possible to permeate the cell membrane or the protein coating, in the case of viral infections. By designing nanorobots capable of identifying and penetrating such pathogens, it would be possible to destroy them by completely deconstructing their genetic material.

While genetic alteration can repair or undo the effects of harmful or undesired mutations or correct biochemical imbalances, treating major physical trauma and non-genetic congenital defects requires actual physical corrective measures. Nanotechnology may be used to accomplish these tasks, with two important advantages: Correction may be done without invasive surgeries and associated secondary damage and risks, and treatment reaction time is greatly reduced, as the tools to do the job are always in place and ready to function.'''

Often, the native fauna of a planet are far better suited to a planet's environment than any colonists who would try to inhabit it. These adverse effects can include anything from weather patterns to the planet's size. Through xenological hybridization, a genetically adapted form of the colonizing species can be developed with the advantageous traits of the native fauna, thus allowing more of the planet to be inhabited.

Regardless of how well understood, or how adeptly improved, a biological system is limited by its inherent nature. Structures and basic physiology can only be altered so far within the confines of a single planet's biology. With understanding of other biologies however, the disparate systems may be fused, forming an entirely new hybrid biology with potential abilities and traits greater than those of any of its parts.'''

Microgravity Industry

PRO_MICROGRAV_MAN_DESC
'''Increases [[metertype METER_INDUSTRY]] by +5 on all Industry-focused colonies in system with an asteroid belt outposts or colonies. Additional claimed asteroid belts do not provide additional benefit.

Mineral resource extraction from sub-planetoid-sized bodies involves challenges and provides opportunities quite distinct from those of full-fledged planets. Lacking sufficient mass to self-liquefy and differentiate, asteroids can provide much easier access to some heavier elements, and lack of a gravity can make extraction for use in space much more efficient. Conversely, the limited size of each source asteroid requires fully portable self-sufficient extraction facilities. As well, the challenges of any microgravity environment must be overcome, requiring redesign of many traditional methods.

The microgravity of low planetary orbit offers great potential for novel manufacturing facility designs, equipment and techniques not possible on planet surfaces. Solids may be held in place with minimal support. Liquids and gases float freely, shaped only by surface tension, unless otherwise manipulated. Factory equipment may be arranged optimally in three dimensions. These conditions permit great increases in efficiency and productivity, if properly exploited.'''

Easily mass produced, they serve best on colonies that place a high priority on industry. Every world focused primarily on industry receives a team of Exobots, greatly increasing industrial production.

Although high level initial design and initial facility setup still require active supervision, the elimination of operators from the actual production process eliminates many bottlenecks.

Explosive or uncontrolled thermonuclear reactions are comparatively simple to cause at scales ranging from small tactical warheads to supergiant stellar furnaces. Controllable, stable and practical power generation from the reaction is somewhat more difficult. The process remains attractive, however, due to the near-limitless supply of fuel and potential for emissions-free operation.'''

PRO_NANOTECH_PROD
Nanotech Production

PRO_NANOTECH_PROD_DESC
Traditional production techniques are fundamentally limited by the size and form of the tools they employ. As a product takes form, its outer layers may prevent direct access and manipulation of the inner structure, requiring inconvenient and inefficient adjustment to the order of assembly. Furthermore, the components of a larger product must be carefully formed and assembled to exacting specifications to ensure they will function as intended when combined. By using nanotechnology to form a complete product in one step, directly from the stock materials, these limitations can be bypassed, dramatically improving efficiency and production speed.

'''Once troublesome gravity well problems are overcome, Gas Giants offer a unique opportunity to harvest usable energy quickly and efficiently. Methods which take advantage of the high density atmosphere and belt-zone circulation allow a significant amount of energy to be easily accrued and transported for use in nearby planets.

Low orbit of planetary bodies provides numerous benefits for power generation compared to planetary surfaces. Direct exposure to nearby solar radiation without atmospheric attenuation, and the orders of magnitude larger structures that may be assembled in microgravity to collect it are significant advantages. The resulting power may be used in orbit, or may be beamed to the planet to support surface industry. As well, new mechanisms of energy conversion become available in orbit, including planetary magnetic field coupling, orbital momentum exchange, and frictional heating with planetary atmospheres, which are uniquely beneficial for specialized applications.'''

As equipment becomes increasingly automated, it becomes capable of fully replicating and maintaining itself without outside support, other than its required raw materials and a requested, or suggested, final product to produce.

PRO_NDIM_ASSMB
N-Dimensional Assembly

PRO_NDIM_ASSMB_DESC
'''Once the greatest fear of N-dimensional physicists, now the noblest goal - to deliberately create a hyperspatial rift between our universe and the next, but inside a dimensional bubble, safely separate from known space-time. Once this is accomplished, it would be a relatively simple matter to tap into the enormous flow of energy that would travel across the rift.

The geometry of physical space has always been a major impediment to the assembly of objects within that space. Objects cannot be collocated, and volumes cannot be simultaneously enclosed and open if their existence is restricted to a mere three dimensions. Moving beyond this limitation, parts of objects can be folded out of the way in a pocket dimensions, and contiguous lines may be passed around other masses by going "off-axis". Similar mechanisms are also used to assemble lower-dimensional objects in configurations that would be impossible without higher-dimensional pathways.'''

PRO_SINGULAR_GEN
Singularity Generation

PRO_SINGULAR_GEN_DESC
'''Harnessing energy from a [[STAR_BLACK]] is significantly more dangerous than harnessing energy from a regular star, but also has potential for significantly greater gains. By building a generator designed to tap into the energy of particle-antiparticle collisions on the event horizon of a singularity, tremendous benefits to industry may be obtained.

As matter is drawn towards a singularity by the intense space-time curvature, or gravitational field, the matter forms a greatly compressed and heated accretion disc. High energy radiation emitted from the disc may be captured and harnessed for power generation. The event horizon of the singularity itself also emits radiation due to the annihilation of virtual particle-antiparticle pairs that form in its vicinity. This method of power generation is significantly more delicate and unstable than the accretion disc method, but can produce an even greater output.'''

PRO_ZERO_GEN
Zero-Point Generation

PRO_ZERO_GEN_DESC
'''Any power generation mechanism that involves a material fuel supply is limited by the relativistic mass-energy relationship: no more energy can be produced than equivalent mass consumed, even with perfect efficiency. By tapping the inherent energy of the vacuum, or zero-point energy, an effectively infinite source is made available. The rate, or power, of this extraction is also theoretically unbounded, with limits only in the available means to collect and use the output.

At appropriate scales and under specific conditions, matter-energy becomes a unified phenomenon. Applied at larger scales, complete control over the structure of matter and the dynamics of energy becomes possible, as does the interchange between the two. Transmutation and replication, at limited scales, become possible. However, despite the enormous rest mass energy equivalence of matter, converting directly to energy for bulk power generation is generally less effective than comparatively simple fusion generation.

Previous production techniques were essentially ways to avoid or remove particularly vexing problems with manipulation of matter. None of these techniques fundamentally changed the basic method however, which was to assemble larger objects out of supplied materials, be they prefabricated subsections, or raw minerals. By converting pure energy directly into the desired material object, the need for supplied materials such as minerals or food can become greatly reduced in times of necessity.'''

CON_ARCH_PSYCH
Architectural Psychology

CON_ARCH_PSYCH_DESC
The form of a structure or inhabited space is not merely guided by the physical limitations of the materials from which it is constructed. Psychological effects on the inhabitants within, or observers outside can have a far greater influence on the success of a design than the strength of a wall or sturdiness of a foundation.

CON_ORGANIC_STRC

CON_ORGANIC_STRC_DESC
'''Buildings formed of inanimate minerals are functional and occasionally elegant, and those of harvested but dead organics are often simple and inexpensive. Actual living structures, however, can be grown into their final shape with no additional labour, as well effect some degree of self-repair when damaged. They may also naturally self-regulate their internal environments, or potentially adapt to varied or changing surroundings as necessary, during or after their initial growth.

A shutter functions as both a solid wall and open window, according to the desire of its user. A room may be refurnished to serve an entirely new purpose, within the limits of the space available. This concept may also be extended to the actual form and structure of an entire building or city, whether mechanical or organic. Eliminating the need for demolition and rebuilding permits much greater infrastructure flexibility and efficiency. Single or isolated structures may also serve many purposes simultaneously, that would previously have required much larger and elaborate fixed designs.'''

CON_ARCH_MONOFILS
Architectural Monofilaments

CON_ARCH_MONOFILS_DESC
Essentially unbreakable and merely a few atoms in diameter, single-crystal filaments have many uses in improving traditional structure designs in durability and economy of construction. The capacity to suspend or stress other materials in previously impossible configurations also permits a wholly new designs. Low weight and high strength filaments are of particular use in large-scale orbital or surface to orbit spanning structures, where variations in gravity across lengths were previously very prohibitive.

CON_ASYMP_MATS
Asymptotic Materials

CON_ASYMP_MATS_DESC
Once certain thresholds of performance are passed, measuring the physical properties of materials for relative comparison becomes impractical in any terms other than orders of magnitude or logarithmic scales. Much like superconductivity in electronics, the tensile strength, toughness, density, elasticity, refractory index and other mechanical properties of materials may be controlled with effectively no limits.

CON_CONTGRAV_ARCH_DESC
'''Increases the [[metertype METER_SUPPLY]] line range of all colonies and outposts by 1.

By fully controlling the orientation and strength of gravitational forces acting upon and existent within a structure, designs may simultaneously exhibit the freedom of weightlessness and the utility of having a defined up and down. The structure itself, and the local environments it seeks to provide, may take any shape in space, extending to great lengths, looping about itself, and making arbitrary interconnections. Simultaneously, local environments within may be infused with a useful tug, which may vary from or be entirely different from immediately adjacent areas. Such versatility permits great new functional designs for social, manufacturing or other uses.'''

When roughly the mass of a small moon or larger, it is no longer sufficient to conceive of what is wrought as a "structure", "station" or "ship". Rather, beyond this scale, the object becomes more like a heavenly body; its gravitational pull influences orbital motions, it may retain an thin atmosphere on its surface, and it may be orbited by, rather than orbiting with, lesser structures.

SHP_SPACE_FLUX_DRIVE
Spatial Flux Drive

SHP_SPACE_FLUX_DRIVE_DESC
Ordinarily, propulsion in space is limited to either propellant or field propulsion. On relatively small scales however, it is possible to propel an object in space much like one could in water: by pushing backwards the medium in which the object is immersed. This requires the manipulation of space itself whereby the smallest units of space are collapsed, forcing the matter they once contained into adjacent units of space. This method of propulsion is very efficient, but dangerous on larger scales and easily detectable due to the dimensional effects. Further research into stealth technologies can reduce the dimensional disruption.

These points will be unable to withstand the gravitational stresses and collapse, destroying the vessel. This necessitates nearly constant maintenance of these points to avoid total structural failure.

SHP_NANOROBO_MAINT
Nano-Robotic Maintenance

SHP_NANOROBO_MAINT_DESC
Just as nanorobots can be used for production, so also can they be used for maintenance. A hull with a complement of centrally organized nanite engineers would be able to rapidly repair damage, even during combat. Such machines would have great difficulty distinguishing organic beings from a part of the hull in need of repair however, and as such this concept could only be applied to automated hulls.

SHP_MASSPROP_SPEC
Mass Propulsion Specialization

SHP_MASSPROP_SPEC_DESC
Traditional propulsion devices operate well on objects of relatively low mass. However, when the mass of a ship approaches that of a small moon, ordinary methods of propulsion are very clumsy and require tremendous amounts of energy. A new approach to propulsion, taking into account the size of the object in question as a fundamental aspect of the system, could allow such vessels to have useful mobility.

SHP_TRANSSPACE_DRIVE
Trans-Spatial Drive

SHP_TRANSSPACE_DRIVE_DESC
'''[[COLONY_BUILDING_TIME_DECREASE]]

Even when spatial dimensions are skewed by relativistic effects, an object generally has constant space-time characteristics. By creating a device which alters the characteristics of space-time itself using quasi-relativistic effects, it would be possible to create a fast, stealthy method of propulsion.'''

SHP_MIDCOMB_LOG
Mid-Combat Logistics

SHP_MIDCOMB_LOG_DESC
When interstellar fleets are in regular, commonplace use, the transfer of personnel and material in the absence of enemy ships is a relatively trivial task. In combat however, when such transfers could potentially have great tactical merit, there is great difficulty with the co-ordinational aspects of logistics due to the possibility of sudden changes in the tactical scenario. By using a single mobile command station, it is possible to organize and enact logistic patterns in the midst of combat.

SHP_ASTEROID_HULLS
Asteroid Hulls

SHP_ASTEROID_HULLS_DESC
Rather than constructing a hull from scratch, it is far easier to take a pre-existing space-borne object and adapt it to fill the role of a ship's hull. Not only would such ships be very inexpensive to produce, but they would also be able to avoid detection by enemy ships by hiding amongst other asteroids.

SHP_HEAVY_AST_HULL
Heavy Asteroid Hulls

SHP_HEAVY_AST_HULL_DESC
Allows construction of larger asteroid hulls

SHP_ASTEROID_REFORM
Asteroid Reformation

SHP_ASTEROID_REFORM_DESC
Through advanced processing of asteroid bodies rock armor can be produced which is as cheap as but more durable than lead armor plating.

SHP_MONOMOLEC_LATTICE
Monomolecular Latticing

SHP_MONOMOLEC_LATTICE_DESC
Asteroid Hulls can be reinforced and armor plated, but the fact remains that the basic substance of which most asteroids are primarily composed is of lesser strength than most modern alloys. However, if the molecular structure of the rock itself were to be rearranged into a crystal lattice, its strength could be increased tremendously, allowing the production of asteroid hulls of previously impossible strengths.

SHP_MULTICELL_CAST
Multi-Cellular Casting

SHP_MULTICELL_CAST_DESC
Even when it is inert, organic material is much more versatile than standard materials. A non-living multi-cellular ship would provide some of the advantages of organic materials without the customary nuisances of organic life.

SHP_DOMESTIC_MONSTER
Domesticated Mega-Fauna

SHP_DOMESTIC_MONSTER_DESC
Though huge and alien the time-tested arts of domestication can also be applied to the space monsters that travel the starlanes. Building Colonies or Outposts at monster nests will enable the raising of domesticated monsters.

SHP_ENDOCRINE_SYSTEMS
Mega-Fauna Endocrine Systems

SHP_ENDOCRINE_SYSTEMS_DESC
The study of space-faring organisms' endocrine systems allows for the expansion of organic ships' internal structures.

SHP_MONOCELL_EXP
Mono-Cellular Expansion

SHP_MONOCELL_EXP_DESC
Multi-cellular organisms tend to have longer life spans than single celled organisms due to specialization and interdependency. However, with the appropriate technological refinements, these aspects of multi-cellular life can be applied to a massive mono-cellular organism, allowing it to have practical functionality in combat.

SHP_CONT_SYMB
Contrived Symbiosis

SHP_CONT_SYMB_DESC
Any ship's hull is in a symbiotic relationship with its makers in that they bring it into being and sustain it, and it performs its desired functions. However, this is a purely behavioral type of symbiosis. Through careful planning and design, an organic ship can be made to have a biological symbiotic relationship with its crew, each providing the other with the essentials of life.

SHP_CONT_BIOADAPT
Controlled Ravenous Bioadaption

SHP_CONT_BIOADAPT_DESC
It is very difficult to predict the actions of a living being to any useful degree of certainty without having an intimate understanding of its behavioral patterns. By placing a life form under harshly competitive developmental conditions, its behavioral patterns can be manipulated, strengthened and effectively utilized in war.

SHP_BIOADAPTIVE_SPEC
Bio-Neural Specialization

SHP_BIOADAPTIVE_SPEC_DESC
As a species evolves mental capabilities, the individuals whose minds are not perfectly attuned to the needs of their bodies cannot compete with those whose minds are perfectly specialized for their bodies. Thus, all evolved life forms have nearly ideal mental development for their type of body. There are no such guarantees for artificial life forms however, and often the true potential of such a being is unrealized due to subtle incompatibilities between mind and body. By specializing the organism's neural patterns to conform to its body type, these incompatibilities can be eliminated.

SHP_FRC_ENRG_COMP
Force-Energy Compression

SHP_FRC_ENRG_COMP_DESC
Typically, the manipulation of energy requires it to be in the form of matter so that potential energy can be stored as desired and released on demand. Matter converted to pure energy stored in the fabric of space-time itself would be more versatile than any material substance, but impossible to contain without advanced force-field technology.

SHP_ENRG_FRIGATE
Military Energy Compression

SHP_ENRG_FRIGATE_DESC
Advanced forcefields allow energy and matter to be combined to make warships, but immense energy is needed to build them at scale.

SHP_QUANT_ENRG_MAG
Quantum Energy Magnification

SHP_QUANT_ENRG_MAG_DESC
'''[[COLONY_BUILDING_TIME_DECREASE]]

Due to quantum uncertainty, it is possible for a particle to arbitrarily gain a small amount of energy or for new particles to temporarily enter existence. By detecting and magnifying these fluctuations in quantum energy, it would be possible to tremendously increase the capabilities of an energy hull.'''

SHP_ENRG_BOUND_MAN
Energy Boundary Manipulation

SHP_ENRG_BOUND_MAN_DESC
'''Whether constructed, grown, or adapted from a pre-existing structure, ships composed of matter must have a logical and co-ordinated structure to allow even basic utility. Pure energy however, has no such restrictions. This allows a pure energy hull to take on any form whatsoever, however impractical it would be from a material standpoint.
'''

SHP_SOLAR_CONT
Solar Containment

SHP_SOLAR_CONT_DESC
A hull constructed from pure energy, while far more versatile than a solid hull, has a disadvantage in that it is unable to harness the potential energy of material objects. If, however, it were made possible to contain a hull composed not of pure energy, but of super-heated gases constantly undergoing a self-sustaining fusion reaction, the limitations of both pure energy and solid matter could be avoided.

SHP_KRILL_SPAWN
Krill Spawner
SHP_KRILL_SPAWN_DESC
Unlocks the [[shippart SP_KRILL_SPAWNER]] ship part, which causes wild space krill to appear in systems with asteroid belts.

SPY_ROOT_DECEPTION

Orbital Construction

CON_ORBITAL_CON_DESC
'''Increases the [[metertype METER_SUPPLY]] line range of all colonies and outposts by 1.

On a planet, there is always a fixed reference direction: "up". Microgravity is effectively isotropic. This single difference has a multitude of consequences for the types of structures that can be built, and which of those forms is the optimal use of space, materials and energy in each environment. As well, the interior configuration of spaces in orbit must be rethought. However, while it is appealing to attempt to completely revolutionize interior design in a paradigm completely independent of the styles used on planet surfaces, the practical use of these spaces will be initial primarily by those who are used to, and adapted for, those planet surfaces. Rather than a complete break from older styles, a gradual transition may be more effective.'''

CON_CONC_CAMP
Concentration Camps

CON_CONC_CAMP_DESC
Typically, when forced to work to death, citizens will put up some resistance and have the sympathy and support of outside observers. However, by carefully creating buildings designed to quench the fire of justice within outsiders, and to promote feelings of worthlessness and subservience in those on the inside, concentration camps can be effectively utilized without fear of revolt.

CON_FRC_ENRG_CAMO
Force-Energy Camouflage

CON_FRC_ENRG_CAMO_DESC
'''Increases the [[metertype METER_STEALTH]] of all buildings by 20.

Ordinary physical structures tend to be both opaque and rigid, being constructed from similarly opaque and rigid natural materials. A force field does not, of necessity, possess these features in any permanent sense, and can be turned on and off or changed from one color to another at will. While most buildings are easily visible far away with a powerful detection apparatus, a force-energy structure - or a regular structure surrounded by a series of camouflage force-fields - would be essentially invisible from great distances.'''

CON_PLANET_DRIVE
Planetary Starlane Drive

CON_PLANET_DRIVE_DESC
Planets in the outermost systems of an empire are often in great danger of attack from enemy fleets, yet these planets can often contain extremely valuable resources and specials. By equipping an entire planet with the means to open and navigate a starlane, it would be possible to move such planets to a safer location in times of necessity.

CON_STARGATE
Stargate

CON_STARGATE_DESC
Particularly in more expansive empires, the need to move ships to a specific defensive location in great haste often exceeds the feasibility. By creating a warp between two or more points in space-time, it can be made possible to move ships even across an entire empire at need, allowing new offensive and defensive strategies.

CON_ART_PLANET
Artificial Planet

CON_ART_PLANET_DESC
'''Gas giants and asteroid belts offer unique opportunities and resources, not only as sites for acquiring valuable - and on occasion extremely rare - resources, but as raw materials in and of themselves for the production of artificial planets. Such planets would offer new centers for production in previously empty or entirely occupied systems. In addition, various key features of the planet can be modified or added during the construction process, potentially allowing the planets size and environment to be specified, or certain planet specials to be added.

On its own, the tech allows for construction of the basic [[buildingtype BLD_ART_PLANET]]. If the empire also has [[tech GRO_GAIA_TRANS]], then [[buildingtype BLD_ART_PARADISE_PLANET]] may be built.

GRO_GENOME_BANK
Genome Bank

GRO_GENOME_BANK_DESC
The unknown variables in genomic calculations for any given species remain severe for all but the simplest genetic repairs, not to mention the changes that a genetic modification can potentially have on a larger multi-species biosphere. To truly realize the benefits of genetic medicine, it is necessary to collect a massive genome database for all the species from all known worlds.

GRO_INDUSTRY_CLONE
Industrial Cloning

GRO_INDUSTRY_CLONE_DESC
Primitive manual nuclear transfer cloning techniques are little more than novelties for large organisms. By applying techniques similar to industrial mass production or biochemical process engineering, it becomes possible to generate dozens, or millions, of full-grown copies of a single genetic blueprint. Populations may be made to order, tailored to meet the specific needs of society.

GRO_TERRAFORM
Terraforming

GRO_TERRAFORM_DESC
Changing the environmental type of a planet is a massive undertaking, the challenge of this process is to a large degree logistical. The precise method depends greatly on the type of planet to be changed and the desired result. However, in all cases much of the surface of the entire planet and its atmosphere needs to be converted to other types of molecules, vented into space or buried under the crust. As such, this process requires most of the planet to be accessible to the terraformers, and cannot be performed on a world with max population less than one.

GRO_TERRAFORM_SHORT_DESC
Allows terraforming

GRO_REMOTE_TERRAFORM
Remote Terraforming

GRO_REMOTE_TERRAFORM_DESC
Traditional terraforming methods treat the planet as a structure and attempt to alter its environment through physical and chemical means. This necessitates that the majority of the planet be accessible to the terraforming species, which generally limits its usefulness. By treating the planet as an organism and altering its physiology indirectly, it is possible to make use of less labour intensive, though more time consuming terraforming methods, allowing outposts on poor and hostile worlds to make use of terraforming.

GRO_BIOTERROR
Bioterror Facilities

GRO_BIOTERROR_DESC
A research center created to safely develop the most dangerous of biological weaponry while keeping prying eyes out. Biological weaponry takes effect too slowly to be of much use in a direct military conflict, but as a weapon of terror it is unsurpassed; a slowly growing contamination will spread panic before it, images of a desperate people quarantined by their own government sowing despair beyond the affected area. However, care must be taken when developing such organisms to ensure they are not accidentally released. Furthermore, utter secrecy is required to dispel the risk of damaging relations with civilians and other empires.

GRO_GAIA_TRANS
Gaia Transformation

GRO_GAIA_TRANS_DESC
Theoretically, it is possible to completely predict the ecology of a single planet by mapping out its entire web of biological interdependence, both sentient and non-sentient, in fractal algorithms. In practice however, this could only be realized by constructing a vast planet-spanning network running a computer program dedicated to regulating the planet's entire biosphere. This computer would become, in effect, the brain of a new type of life - a single planetary organism, with intelligent citizens as part of its fabric, subject to the greater will.

GRO_GAIA_TRANS_SHORT_DESC
Allows Gaia Transformation

LRN_OBSERVATORY_I
Observatory

LRN_OBSERVATORY_I_DESC
Studying and understanding the nature of stars and their internal and external attributes provides powerful insight into the nature of stellar phenomena and planetary bodies. Furthermore, fractal algorithms can be employed to decipher the dispersal of starlanes throughout the galaxy, allowing any stars which are in some way connected, however indirectly, to the known network of starlanes to be identified an monitored.

LRN_SOLAR_MAN
Solar Manipulation

LRN_SOLAR_MAN_DESC
Different star types not only have their own distinct attributes and opportunities for exploitation, but also tend to give rise to a particular planet type. Often, a star of a particular type will give a desired bonus, but will almost certainly be devoid of any desirable planets, or will not be present in an opportune location in the galaxy. By manipulating the high-energy reactions within a star's core, it would be possible to either reverse or accelerate the natural processes within the star, allowing it to be changed to an entirely different type at need.

SPY_CUSTOM_ADVISORIES
Empire Intelligence Agency

SPY_CUSTOM_ADVISORIES_DESC
'''The Empire Intelligence Agency gathers and organizes information from many sources, including spies, common informers, and official chains of command reporting.  The most important items of information are presented each turn as Situation Reports (SitReps).  If a SitRep is repeated from turn to turn more often than you really need for remembering the information, you can ignore the SitRep for the current turn by double-clicking its icon, or for multiple turns via right-click menu on the SitRep's icon.

Many of the SitReps are determined automatically, but additional custom SitReps can be specified by editing the file default/customizations/custom_sitreps.txt
(Note: in a multiplayer game, the content files of the Server are the ones which determine what SitReps are sent to empires.)
More particulars on the FreeOrion scripting language, such as for these custom SitReps, can be found at our wiki:  http://www.freeorion.org/index.php/Free_Orion_Content_Script_(FOCS)
There are four preset (possibly translated) labels for use with custom sitreps, so that they get placement at the top of the SitRep window.  More information on how to use the labels can be found on the wiki, and in the custom_sitreps.txt.
These four labels are
"[[CUSTOM_1]]"

AI_FIRST_TURN_GREETING_MSG101
What have we done to deserve your wrath, oh mighty ones?

AI_FIRST_TURN_GREETING_MSG102
Don't bother with us, we have nothing to offer that might be of interest for you.

AI_FIRST_TURN_GREETING_MSG103
Please spare your humble servants, and our gratitude shall be forever yours!

AI_FIRST_TURN_GREETING_MSG201
Stay the hell away from us!

AI_FIRST_TURN_GREETING_MSG203
Stay away from us, and we will stay away from you!

AI_FIRST_TURN_GREETING_MSG301
We won't bother you, but if you don't leave us alone, you shall find us well prepared to defend ourselves!

AI_FIRST_TURN_GREETING_MSG302
In both of our interests, let us leave each other alone.

AI_FIRST_TURN_GREETING_MSG401
To do battle with you will be an honor.

AI_FIRST_TURN_GREETING_MSG402
Ave, Human, morituri te salutant!

AI_FIRST_TURN_GREETING_MSG403
Greetings strangers! We hope you are worthy doing battle with.

AI_FIRST_TURN_GREETING_MSG501
Welcome, dear enemy, our fearless warriors are waiting for you...

AI_FIRST_TURN_GREETING_MSG502
Ha! You think you can stand up to us? Well, bring it on!

AI_FIRST_TURN_GREETING_MSG503
A bunch of foolish aliens stumbling right into our arms - a day can't start better!

AI_FIRST_TURN_GREETING_MSG504
Enjoy yourself as long as you can, for the last thing you'll see is the cleansing fire of our powerful weapons!

AI_FIRST_TURN_GREETING_MSG505
Get the hell out of our galaxy!

AI_FIRST_TURN_GREETING_MSG506
Prepare to die.

AI_FIRST_TURN_GREETING_MSG601
Alien scum! We shall cleanse the galaxy of your filthy presence!

AI_FIRST_TURN_GREETING_MSG602
Worthless insects, you dare to challenge our mighty empire?!

AI_FIRST_TURN_GREETING_MSG603
Exterminating you shall be a genuine pleasure!

AI_FIRST_TURN_GREETING_MSG604
Don't bother to look to us for mercy, for you will find none here.

AI_FIRST_TURN_GREETING_MSG605
A meek lamb who wants to dance with lions is always welcome at our table - as the entrée of course...

AI_FIRST_TURN_GREETING_MSG606
Despair and defeat is what you're going to find at our hands.

AI_FIRST_TURN_GREETING_MSG607
Surrender now, and we might consider letting you live... as our slaves forever.
