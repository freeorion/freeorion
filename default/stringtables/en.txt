SM_KRILL_1
Small Krill Swarm
SM_KRILL_1_DESC
'''Space Krill are small, vaguely insectile organisms that feed on the dust and rocks far from any gravity well. Individually simple, Krill communicate via coherent light, allowing the swarm to coordinate and calculate trajectories. Though normally not aggressive, their numbers become a hazard for navigation, and block resupply. The high quantity of low-G resources found in an asteroid belt, provide Krill with the perfect conditions to rapidly multiply.'''

FREEORION_VISION
FreeOrion, an open-source game based on Master of Orion, is a turn-based game of epic space strategy that builds on the classic '4X' model by incorporating the nation-building elements of games such as Europa Universalis 2 and a versatile tactical combat engine. While its modular, open-source design allows for a significant degree of customization of the game engine and the story elements by the community, the FreeOrion team is dedicated to the construction of a living, breathing universe in a 'grand campaign' model.

PEACE_TITLE
Peace
PEACE_TEXT
Peace is the diplomatic state between empires in which they mutually agree not to attack each other's ships or planets, not to obstruct each other's [[encyclopedia SUPPLY_TITLE]] lines, and not to impede colonization.

OUTPOSTS_TITLE
Outposts
OUTPOSTS_TEXT
'''Outposts are unmanned stations, which can be founded in places too hostile for a colony to survive. They have no population, and normally produce no resources. But they create [[encyclopedia SUPPLY_TITLE]] (with the right tech) and provide vision. Colonies can be founded on planets that already have an Outpost. To build an Outpost, you need to put an [[shippart CO_OUTPOST_POD]] on a ship. Outposts are also formed when the population of a colony drops to zero for any reason.'''

GROWTH_FOCUS_TITLE
Growth Focus
GROWTH_FOCUS_TEXT
'''The Growth Focus represents exporting rare materials and substances that can increase population of planets. Is only available in certain situations: on some homeworlds, and on planets with growth specials that can be exported.

A planet focused on Growth increases the max Population only of other planets connected to it by [[encyclopedia SUPPLY_TITLE]] lines.

A Homeworld focused on Growth only helps other planets of the same species.

Growth Special planets focused on growth, only help a single classification of species. Some specials function for organic species only, some for lithic species only, and some for robotic species only.'''

PROTECTION_FOCUS_TITLE
Protection Focus
PROTECTION_FOCUS_TEXT
'''The Protection focus represents a planet wholly focused on defending itself. [[encyclopedia TROOP_TITLE]], Planetary [[encyclopedia DEFENSE_TITLE]], and Planetary [[encyclopedia SHIELDS_TITLE]] are doubled.'''

INDUSTRY_TITLE
Industry
INDUSTRY_TEXT
'''Industry represents the production and modification of physical goods. It is needed to produce buildings, space ships and other projects.

The Industry of a planet can be used for any production projects of [[encyclopedia SUPPLY_TITLE]] line connected planets. Any un-allocated Industry is lost each turn.

Each project has a minimum number of turns required to build it. For example, if a project that cost 15 PPs, and had a minimum time of 3 turns, 5 PPs is the maximum that could be put towards its completion per turn.
The project at the top of the queue is given PPs first. Any remaining PP are then given to the next project in the queue, and if there is still more remaining to the next-- and so on. You can re-prioritize the items in the queue by dragging the most important items closer to the top.
'''

RESEARCH_TITLE
Research
RESEARCH_TEXT
'''The Research (or RP "Research Points") of all planets in the empire is combined to discover new technologies. Any Research that cannot be spent on a tech is lost each turn. Each tech has a minimum number of turns required to research it. For example, if a tech that cost 15 RPs, and had a minimum time of 3 turns, 5 RPs is the maximum that could be put towards its completion per turn.
The tech at the top of the queue is given RPs first. Any remaining RP are then given to the next tech in the queue, and if there is still more remaining to the next-- and so on. You can re-prioritize the items in the queue by dragging the most important items closer to the top.

Research does not require [[encyclopedia SUPPLY_TITLE]] line connections to be used.'''

HAPPINESS_TITLE
Happiness
HAPPINESS_TEXT
'''Happiness doesn't do anything yet.'''

INFRASTRUCTURE_TITLE
Infrastructure
INFRASTRUCTURE_TEXT
'''The term Infrastructure refers to technical structures that support a colonized planet: energy, transportation, telecommunication and social services for the citizens.'''

DEFENSE_TITLE
Defense
DEFENSE_TEXT
'''The Defense meter of a planet represents the power of the ground to space weapons installed. It's comparable to the Damage value of a space ship.'''

SHIELDS_TITLE
Shields
SHIELDS_TEXT
'''The term Shields combines all kinds of protective force-fields. They are usually the first barrier incoming attacks have to overcome. There are two distinct types of shields that work very differently: ship shields and planetary barrier shields.

Ship shields: Reduce the damage sustained by each hit by the strength rating of the shield part. A weapon can only penetrate a shield if it's damage value is higher than the shield's strength.

Planetary barrier shields: Act more like some kind of planetary armor. Their strength is reduced by each hit unless they are completely depleted, further hits will finally get through and damage planetary structures. Planetary barrier shields regenerate their strength each turn at a certain rate.

Both space ships and planets have a Shields meter.'''

STEALTH_TITLE
Stealth
STEALTH_TEXT
'''The term Stealth represents the ability of an object to dodge all kinds of sensors. Only empires with a [[encyclopedia DETECTION_TITLE]] higher than or equal to the Stealth value can see the object.

Space ships, buildings, specials, systems and planets have a Stealth meter.'''

DETECTION_TITLE
Detection Strength
DETECTION_TEXT
'''The term Detection Strength represents the technological level of an empire's sensors. An empire can only see objects that have a [[encyclopedia STEALTH_TITLE]] value lower than or equal to its Detection Strength and are within [[encyclopedia DETECTION_RANGE_TITLE]] of a controlled space ship or planet.

Empires have a Detection Strength meter.'''

DETECTION_RANGE_TITLE
Detection Range
DETECTION_RANGE_TEXT
'''The Detection Range represents the distance in uu that sensors can reach. An empire can only see objects that have a [[encyclopedia STEALTH_TITLE]] value lower than or equal to its [[encyclopedia DETECTION_TITLE]] and are within Detection Range of a controlled space ship or planet.

Space ships and planets have a Detection Range meter. There is the option to display Detection Range circles in the Galaxy Map section of the Options menu.'''

TROOP_TITLE
Troops
TROOP_TEXT
'''The term Troops combines all kinds of military forces capable of operating on a planets surface.

The Troop meter on a planet represents the power of the defending ground forces. The invading force must send a more powerful force (i.e. a higher cumulative number) to conquer a planet.'''

ORGANIC_SPECIES_TITLE
Organic Metabolism
ORGANIC_SPECIES_TEXT
'''Organic species are more or less, 'life as we know it'. These species' max population can be increased when their connected homeworld is set on [[encyclopedia GROWTH_FOCUS_TITLE]], or when an Organic Growth Special is colonized, and focused on Growth. Organic Growth specials are marked with a little green 'O' in the corner.'''

LITHIC_SPECIES_TITLE
Lithic Metabolism
LITHIC_SPECIES_TEXT
'''Lithic species are silicon or mineral-based. These species' max population can be increased when their connected homeworld is set on [[encyclopedia GROWTH_FOCUS_TITLE]], or when a Lithic Growth Special is colonized, and focused on Growth. Lithic Growth specials are marked with a little grey 'L' in the corner.'''

ROBOTIC_SPECIES_TITLE
Robotic Metabolism
ROBOTIC_SPECIES_TEXT
'''Robotic species are sapient machines. These species' max population can be increased when their connected homeworld is set on [[encyclopedia GROWTH_FOCUS_TITLE]], or when a Robotic Growth Special is colonized, and focused on Growth. Robotic Growth specials are marked with a little red 'R' in the corner.'''

PHOTOTROPHIC_SPECIES_TITLE
Phototrophic Metabolism
PHOTOTROPHIC_SPECIES_TEXT
'''Phototrophic species live mainly or entirely on sunlight. These species' max population is greatly influenced by the brightness of the local star -- the bigger the better. Growth specials do not benefit them.

Population changes:
Blue Star: Tiny +3 , Small +6 , Medium +9 , Large +12 , Huge +15.
White Star: Tiny +1.5 , Small +3 , Medium +4.5 , Large +6 , Huge +7.5.
Yellow Star, Orange Star: No changes.
Red Star, Neutron Star: Tiny -1 , Small -2 , Medium -3 , Large -4 , Huge -5.
Black Hole, No Star: Tiny -10 , Small -20 , Medium -30 , Large -40 , Huge -50.'''

SELF_SUSTAINING_SPECIES_TITLE
Self-Sustaining Metabolism
SELF_SUSTAINING_SPECIES_TEXT
'''Self-Sustaining species may be energy or crystalline beings or something even stranger. Their commonality is that they need no sustenance, so their max population is very high. While there are no specials that boost their growth, their max population is equal to a species that is provided with all three growth specials.'''

TELEPATHIC_TITLE
Telepathy
TELEPATHY_TEXT
'''Telepathic species are immune to mind-control and make it easier to research [[tech LRN_PSIONICS]].'''

XENOPHOBIC_SPECIES_TITLE
Xenophobic
XENOPHOBIC_SPECIES_TEXT
'''Xenophobic species will automatically divert some of their industrial efforts into harassing other species that are nearby. The affected nearby species will suffer an industrial penalty due to this harassment. A Xenophobic species of Self-Sustaining metabolism will also find the presence of alien species nearby to be disruptive to its natural balances (whether due to some direct effect or simply due to wasted energies being applied to harassing the alien species, has not been determined) resulting in a reduced maximum population.

Xenophobic species start with [[tech CON_CONC_CAMP]].'''

FUEL_TITLE
Fuel
FUEL_TEXT
'''Fuel allows ships to travel the star-lanes. When entering a star-lane a ship consumes 1 unit of fuel. Fuel is not used up at any other time. [[encyclopedia SUPPLY_TITLE]] lines will fully refuel a ship. If a ship travels beyond friendly supply lines, fuel will slowly regenerate when the ship is outside of the star-lanes.'''

SUPPLY_TITLE
Supply
SUPPLY_TEXT
'''Supply lines are shown by coloring star-lanes with an empire's color. Planets connected by supply lines can share physical resources -- production created on one planet, can be used on any connected planet to build ships or structures. A set of systems with supply connections between them are called a 'Resource Group'.  Supply lines can also be used to refill the [[encyclopedia FUEL_TITLE]] supply of ships.  A set of core supply starlanes for an empire (the set of least-jump starlanes connecting the resource-producing systems of each Resource Group) will have greater thickness than the non-core starlanes.  If PP is currently being wasted within the Resource Group the outer bands of the core starlanes will be a contrasting color.

The supply meter on a planet represents the number of star-lanes supply can reach.'''


FLEET_UPKEEP_TITLE
Fleet Upkeep
FLEET_UPKEEP_TEXT
'''The cost of a fleet is more than the sum of the cost of its ships due to the operational costs associated with managing multiple ships. When producing new ships, costs increase by 1% for each ship already owned by the empire. The cost of the [[shippart CO_COLONY_POD]], [[shippart CO_SUSPEND_ANIM_POD]] and [[shippart CO_OUTPOST_POD]] as well as all the colony buildings instead increase by 6% for each planet already owned by the empire.'''

EVACUATION_TITLE
Evacuation
EVACUATION_TEXT
'''The [[buildingtype BLD_EVACUATION]] project when built will remove the population of a planet. Each turn some of the population will be removed. If there are planets colonized by the same species with free space, and connected by [[encyclopedia SUPPLY_TITLE]] lines, one will be randomly chosen and the population will move there. If there are no appropriate planets available, the population disappears into the vastness of space.
During an evacuation production drops to nothing. When the colony is empty, it reverts to an [[encyclopedia OUTPOSTS_TITLE]]. It still belongs to the same empire, and may be re-colonized once the [[buildingtype BLD_EVACUATION]] deletes itself.'''

AI_LEVELS_TITLE
AI Aggression Levels

AI_LEVELS_TEXT
'''AI aggression levels are meant to be roughly akin to difficulty levels, but not exactly, particularly in that they are differentiated in various aspects of risk-taking and aggression, with only some actual limitations being applied to the lower level ones. They can all still play pretty well, but the lower aggression ones may be a bit easier to manage, even if not necessarily easier to actually take over. The more aggressive ones do a bit better over the course of a game.

AIs rename their capital planet on turn 1, adding a prefix. Once you discover their home system you can determine their personality.
The current prefixes are:

Beginner: 
[[AI_CAPITOL_NAMES_BEGINNER]]

Turtle: 
[[AI_CAPITOL_NAMES_TURTLE]]

Cautious: 
[[AI_CAPITOL_NAMES_CAUTIOUS]]

Moderate: 
[[AI_CAPITOL_NAMES_TYPICAL]]

Aggressive: 
[[AI_CAPITOL_NAMES_AGGRESSIVE]]

Maniacal: 
[[AI_CAPITOL_NAMES_MANIACAL]]'''

STRUCTURE_TITLE
Structure
STRUCTURE_TEXT
'''Structure is amount of damage that ship can take until it is destroyed. Structure can be restored by repairing.'''

SP_SCYLIOR_DESC
'''Description:
Scyliori are shelled cephalopods similar to a Nautilus. They possess advanced vision provided by four eyes and have four antennae containing millions of neuromasts, allowing the Scyliori to detect changes in water pressure and also electrical fields. Scyliori have three large, strong feeding tentacles which they use to grasp and hold tools or food while it is broken up by the beak and ingested.

Chromatophores provide the race with their main form of communication. When two Scyliori wish to communicate with each other, they rapidly change the coloring and patterning of their skin.

Scyliori are without gender and reproduce in an iteroparous style. The lifespan of a Scylior is roughly 30 years in which they never stop growing, hatching with a shell diameter of only 5cm and experiencing roughly 10 percent growth each year.

Society:
The remnant of a once-mighty telepathic hive brain, referred to as 'the Mind', is treated by the Scyliori as a benevolent god. It has instilled in them a mission to journey the stars in hopes of returning to its former might. Scyliori are highly social and came to love learning things and sharing knowledge with the Mind.

History:
Millennia ago an expedition of the precursors discovered the Mind controlling the whole planet with his telepathic powers. The Mind immediately reached out and began copying the knowledge of the scientists and their ship crew, but the scientists cut out most of the Mind's brain and took it with them as a sample. The rest survived and lusted to recover the memories that had been taken from it. The Mind, however, was immobile, and for the time being, had no nearby intelligent beings to act as it's hands. Enter the Scyliori.

SP_GYSACHE_DESC
'''The Gysache are a herbivorous species that has always been prey. They seek to remove all that threatens them, until every place in the universe is safe.

Description:
The Gysache are bipedal, each leg has two forward knees and one backward knee in between. When they crouch, the leg folds into an efficient 'W' making them only half a meter tall (compared to 2.5 meters when fully erect).
Their oblong bodies lack anything resembling a head, instead they have three identical eye stalks that are located at the forward tip of the body. A small mouth is located at the base of them.

Personality:
The Gysache are always wary of predators and are easily alarmed. Their natural response is to run away from everything. Their government system is dispersed as each individual is completely independent and forms no bonds with other individuals. However, they do have a herding tendency and this keeps them together when faced with danger.

Homeworld:
Their homeworld has a thick atmosphere of nitrogen, ammonia and carbon dioxide. Most parts of it are moist but it lacks large oceans, only 5% of its surface is covered in water. The main topographical features are enormous high rocky mesas cut by mile deep canyons the bottoms of which contain the only standing water.

SP_CHATO_DESC
'''Description:
The Chato'matou'Gormoshk are actually two species together, however it is not entirely clear if the connection between the species should be called symbiosis or parasitism. The master species are the Chato'matou, crystalline life forms about 30 centimeters in height and 10 centimeters in width. Their color ranges from a light blue to a deep crimson. They get the energy they need to live from the sun or in exceptional cases from the Gormoshk they are attached to. The Gormoshk are predatory animals formerly living in underground caverns. Their bodies are flat and round and rest on five insect-like legs. The Chato'matou attach themselves to the flat part on top of the Gormoshk's bodies, directly above the brain. Through a crystalline outgrowth they can control the Gormoshk completely.

Social Structure:
In Chato'matou society, age is the most important factor as they are nearly immortal. Every command the elders issue is obeyed at once and to disobey an elder is the greatest crime in Chato'matou society. They developed a system to transmit signals without delay throughout an entire colony, enabling them to converse with near the speed of light. This greatly enhanced the species mental capabilities, as all new ideas and theories could be instantly processed throughout the colony. The Gormoshk are valued as mounts and well cared for under normal circumstances, however they are also seen mostly as animals.

The Trith are a mixture of matter and enormous psychic energies. Their shape is vaguely humanoid. All Trith are telepathic, and herein lies the reason for their rage: while the Trith can learn to keep their own thoughts to themselves, they are unable to tune out the thoughts of others. To mature Trith this is merely vexing, but for young Trith it can be fatal. Sometimes, Trith that gain their telepathic ability before adolescence are not ready to cope with the combined minds of all people in the universe screaming at them and go mad or die.

Social Structure:
The Trith are a theocracy led by the priests of Quaran-Dor (The God of the Mind). They are united in the single goal of eliminating all other thinking species to silence the thought-noise in the universe.

Hhhoh locomotion is performed by using their two, large front legs, while using their hind leg to balance their large back. They also have four long trunk-like appendages of 8 meters in length, with four sharp fingered claws used to handle objects. When not in use, Hhhohs curl these trunks under their bodies and bury them in large fat pouches to conserve heat. They are omnivorous but do not actively hunt or farm large domesticated life.

Personality:
Hhhohs describe themselves as social pragmatists. Elders are very much revered, some living close to 230 years. Their sloth-like disposition makes them aversive to any fast movements, as well as hasty decisions.

SP_EAXAW_DESC
'''Description:
The Eaxaw have 3 body forms. First is the newborn larval form, then the male form and lastly the adult female form. All forms are completely blind and use touch, smell, hearing and a sense for electric currents to explore their world. The female form is a segmented worm approximately 8 meters long. At the front is a three-beaked mouth that is used to dig extensive tunnel systems. The neural network of the female is distributed along chains of neural nodes that run the length of the body. Most of the rest of the body is musculature and the armored outer body segments provide support. These outer segments have a small overlap much like scales, under which larvae are grown. Eaxaw in their male form are much smaller and rather dim witted. At the end of their tail is a complex grasping claw that comes in very specialized varieties.

Social Structure:
Eaxaw are organized into matriarchal breeding groups. A female keeps a "harem" of approximately 200 males which protect, feed and mate with her. Any new males that the female births are added to the harem but are frequently traded with other females like a currency. This ensures genetic diversity and promotes a wide variety of males to perform specialized tasks. The highest ranking females (having the largest and most diverse Harems) form the Great Matriarchal Council which sets the global agenda for the Eaxaw.

History:
A long time ago a derelict ship of the Precursors crashed on the Eaxaw homeworld. As the Eaxaw learned some of the ship's secrets they deduced that there were other intelligent species. Their great matriarchal council soon issued its greatest proclamation: "All of this must go!"

SP_DERTHREAN_DESC
'''Description:
The Derthrean consciousness represents a half parasitic, half symbiotic relationship of viruses living in the bodies of plants. The virus has no intelligence and without the virus, the plant is but an empty shell yet together, their neural synapses are compatible and form a reasonable being. Although the virus brings awareness to the plant, the virus is also toxic to its nervous system, inflicting great amounts of pain, slowly destroying the plant as the virus spawns and in the end, killing it. This means that the greater the intelligence of a Derthrean, the more pain he endures.

Social Structure:
The Derthrean are a sharply divided race, split by the legacy of their forebears into castes. They are born into a caste, they mate in their caste, and they die as a member of a caste. Because the breeding has been so isolated throughout the millennia, there are even physical varieties in different castes. The castes are divided as follows: the most benevolent Priest caste, the Worker caste, the Grower caste, the Provider caste, the Scholar caste and the most despised of all, the Warrior caste. Religion plays a fundamental role in their society. Each Derthrean is a pacifist and lives to please their Goddess, in hopes of relieving the terrible burden of pain and earning forgiveness for the betrayal and bloodlust of their ancestors.

A leaf has direct control over the small length of vine to which it is attached. Laenfa have high underwater mobility and reasonable ground mobility as they are able to swim and slither like a serpent. When Laenfa are attached, the effectiveness of their telepathic communication increases, allowing them to synchronize the motions of a single vine for more effective transportation.

Social Structure:
The Laenfa have a unified culture due to their telepathy but because their telepathic communication weakens with distance, there is a large central vine that decides on most important decisions. This vine carries out its debates in secret but takes into account the voices of all Laenfa it is able to detect. The Laenfa carry out their duties with hive-like efficiency with each individual working for the collective goals of gaining knowledge of other species and protecting knowledge of themselves.

A large mechanical tentacle extends from the center of four of the faces (the other two being top and bottom) these serve primary for locomotion and heavy lifting. The Cray communicate by wireless radio. They are impressively parallelized and can hold an average of four trains of thought at once, frequently having more than one conversation at a time, often several with the same person.

Social Structure:
The Cray are a tribal society. Each tribe is formed around a single Cray known as a Master Craftsman who has the skills to build and maintain Cray. Because the Cray are so badly designed even the Master Craftsmen rarely get them perfect and each tribe gets its own “racial characteristics” based on the idiosyncrasies of its Master Craftsman's work.
Day to day decisions run on an extremely complex web of favors. All Cray will happily help their kin if asked and afterwards both will remember exactly what the debt is. While not the most efficient way of running an economy this system means that within a tribe the Cray will owe or be owed favors by a good portion of the community fostering exceptionally strong social bonds and that is just the way they like it.

The Cynos are part of a mother plant which resembles a 90-meter high agave plant. Its huge fronds are a bluish aquamarine color radiating from a central bulb that forms the core of the plant. The extensive but rather shallow root system sprouts offshoots to grow adjacent to the central plant. A single plant can live up to 5000 years. There are numerous "brood chambers" inside the fronds in which the Cynos are "born" and regenerate.

A Cyno starts as a small bulb inside the brood chamber, grows into a full sized individual within a few days and detaches itself. It is 3.5 meters long and roughly rectangular shaped with a tapering vine at each corner. These limbs are used for movement, feeding and fighting alike. A Cyno is capable of approximately 30 hours of independent activity before it has to feed at a mother plant—artificial substitutes for this feed are possible, but result in the infertility of the Cyno, thus all Cyno leaving their homeworld become infertile.

Social Structure:
Cynos are highly cooperative and altruistic in protecting the mother plants. They have a consensus government strongly influenced by the mother plants, which are mindless but still communicate through the Cynos on a chemical level and manipulate their moods.

Reason for Staying:
The Cynos cannot reproduce without their mother plants, nor can they bring themselves to plant a seed anywhere but their homeworld.

Phinnerts are tree-dwelling mammals with size varying from 1 to 2 meters tall. They have long arms, with a wingspan of about twice their height. They have hairy, retractable flaps of skin that stretch from wrist to ankle and allow for fully functional flight in low gravity. They are very agile fliers and can catch flying bug-like creatures with a fully prehensile nose appendage. Like bats they can use echo-location, this sense is not highly developed though.

Social Structure:
Life is much shorter for Phinnerts than for most other sentient life, owing to the many dangers of the swamp. All Phinnerts are generally treated as extended family by each other and grudges do not last long. There is no central authority, there's only a vague hierarchy. The balance of power can change very quickly with the high mortality rate. Society is far less individualistic, and more focused on the group.

Homeworld: 
Their planet has low gravity and a very thick atmosphere. Its composition is unique as it has a low proportion of heavier metals, but a much higher proportion of other heavy elements, particularly noble gases. It also has very stable tectonic formations meaning that the surface of the crust is very flat, and so is mostly covered with shallow, standing water. The entire world is like a giant everglade.

Its only appendage is a single tentacle that is used to sense sound and infrared light, it is also used for communication via ultrasound. Sslith are able to flex their bodies into other shapes, an ability originally evolved for the purpose of sliding into the shells of Vreen (a creature that recedes into its shell when it detects danger). Their flexibility allows them to move astonishingly fast in the oceans, by a ripple effect that looks like they are folding themselves through the water. They don't have a central brain, a Sslith's mental capacity is a collection of multiple nodes that are linked together to form a distributed consciousness allowing a Sslith to perform many tasks at once.

Social Structure:
The Sslith are organized into groups called Pnacra which serve as independent governmental units. Though there are a few global laws that all Sslith in all Pnacra obey, each Pnacra has it's own rules and laws as to conduct and actions. The Pnacra move around of their own accord, and have no fixed geographic location. If two or more of them meet, then members who are discontented with their present Pnacra can move to another to try out its ways and customs.

Fifty-Seven are omnivores: eating flocks of small flying creatures with the same relish as the floating phytoplankton. Since they remain aloft their entire lives and have no manipulator limbs, the Fifty-Seven have no material technology.

Personality:
The Fifty-Seven show little interest in the rest of the galaxy, or indeed in the parts of their planet that they don't use. The bulk of their attention individually, and culturally is focused on math. They do seem eager for new mathematical puzzles, so if research problems can be phrased properly...

The Setinon evolved from genetic defense cells protecting a larger organism from parasites and viruses. They are about 1 mm across with multiple sub sub-compartments and structures. Proteins and nucleic acids are taking the place of neurons of the more standard minds of sentient organisms. They use biological constructs (requiring thousands of Setinon operators) to execute tasks their microscopic nature wouldn't normally allow them to carry out.

Social Structure:

SP_RAAAGH_DESC
'''The Raaagh are 1.5 meter tall stripe-furred bipeds. The body is held leaning forward at 45 degrees, leaving the fanged jaws, and clawed arms free to fight, build or capture prey. Triangular ears and slit pupils give a cat-like appearance. The tiny young hatch from a clutch of a dozen eggs at once. Little care or attention is paid to the young at this stage-- they must survive on their own competing against their siblings for hiding places and stealing food like vermin. After three years usually only one is left, and the surviving young begin to learn to speak. This suddenly activates parental instincts, and the survivor is carefully raised as a member of the Pride.

Personality:
Extreme territoriality is the Raaagh's most distinctive trait- woven throughout their daily lives and culture. Related to that is a preference for the familiar and known. Curiosity is minimal, which probably explains their stone age technology.

Homeworld:
The Raaagh homeworld is of the Terran type. Sea and land are more or less evenly spread out, with the largest continent covering only 4% of planet's surface. The many small continents and large islands encourage a territorial attitude.

Reason for Staying:
There's not bit of land big enough for an individual Raaagh to live on that hasn't been fought over for centuries. The genetic compulsion of a Raaagh is to guard his territory with his life, and when possible to expand into adjacent land. Abandoning one's territory is inconceivable, and a Raaagh forcibly removed from his territory goes violently insane.

SP_SILEXIAN_DESC
'''The Silexians are a race of ecological maintenance robots. They see their own existence as a means of bringing biological beauty and balance to the galaxy.

Description:
As each type of Silexian is customized for a specific task, there are variations in appearance. The majority of Silexians however, share many similar features: They are wholly artificial robotic beings made primarily of metals. They have an antennae used for short range radio communication, advanced tactile sensors as well as wide-frequency photon detectors.
Silexians generally have a flat base equipped with wheels and rocket boosters, but the occasional model is bipedal, to allow greater agility. Many have pincer-like appendages and injector tubules for manipulating objects.

Social Structure:
The Silexians have a hierarchical caste system under a dictatorship government. Each Silexian is created for a specific job, and fills that job until declared obsolete. There is no social mobility. In fact the very idea would be alien and somewhat unwholesome to a Silexian. The race is led by a caste of supervisors giving work assignments, determine upgrades and declare models obsolete. Supervisors themselves defer to the Prime Operator, whom nobody has the authority to deem obsolete, and therefore is practically immortal.

History:
The Silexians were created by the Caretakers in order to increase the efficiency and automation of their environmental maintenance projects. Eventually, all of the Caretakers’ worlds were inhabited and maintained by the peaceful and loyal Silexians. When the Caretakers left the galaxy, some Silexians were abandoned.

SP_KOBUNTURA_DESC
'''Description:
A Kobuntura is composed of trillions of magnetic dust particles. Their dense core of vibrating molecules generates a magnetic field which manipulates a less dense cloud of particles orbiting it in complex patterns. Kobuntura can directly detect and manipulate objects on the outer reaches of their particle clouds, but can indirectly detect, manipulate and communicate with objects and individuals much further away using there magnetic fields. The primary method of locomotion involves interaction with the planet’s magnetic field. Whenever a Kobuntura moves, there is a small chance that the movement will magnetize and agitate the surrounding dust particles to a sufficient extent to trigger a chain reaction which causes a new fully matured Kobuntura to form in a matter of seconds.

Social Structure:
The Kobuntura have a guild system since ancient times, but one of the guilds, the Dark Enclave specialized in martial arts, has gained control over all the other guilds and established a military dictatorship. Despite this, there are no secrets amongst Kobuntura as they can't communicate without all the other Kobuntura noticing. Recreation and trade are very limited, as the sole intent of the Dark Enclave, and indeed all of Kobuntura society, is to find one of the Precursor species, the Builders, and unlock the greatest secrets of construction. This goal is the impetus driving their entire civilization.

SP_UGMORS_DESC
'''The Ugmors is a race of sentient yeast which uses rocks and minerals to make temporary bodies designed to perform specific tasks.

Social Structure:
The Larar drifts are the true center of the species. These masses of yeast sit on top of the hottest part of the lava seas and absorb energy. When enough energy is available a large colony of supercharged yeast will gather large rocks at the edge of the lava pool and join them together to form an Ugmor. The Ugmors were originally designed to get from one lava pool to another, but have since developed into a very complex society. The Larar drifts are not very intelligent on their own, acting as more of a central memory which carries out the directives of the most recent Ugmor to be privileged enough to return to the Larar drifts. 

Ugmors have a very unified form of government. It resembles a hive, but without a central queen. This is because all Ugmors start out with the same racial memories and agenda. When something new is discovered the Ugmor who discovered it usually returns to the nearest Larar drift to share his discovery with the rest of the species.

Description:
An Ugmor can take on many shapes, but all of them consist of rocks or sheets of metal connected by a sticky fibrous material. They are extremely durable and can even live in empty space for several hours. In their natural environment they can live for up to five years before cooling down and dying of “old age.” Ugmors as a race are not very bright. While the Larar pools see the value of intelligence, they tend to see it as a trait which should be grown in new Ugmors only in moderation.

Homeworld:
The Ugmor homeworld is a rocky planet that rotates very quickly (once every 3 and a half hours). 30% of its surface is covered by seas of lava and liquid metals.

A Hidden Gardener, by means of enzymes, the encapsulation and releases of seeds, and the control of water, tends its garden to produce precisely the rotting plant matter it needs to survive.

Fungal-type life-forms seldom have much use for brains of any type, but the Gardener's unusual, and thoughtful approach to providing itself with food provides enough additional energy to make it work.

Their terran homeworld is an eerily park-like place with plants arranged with unnatural precision, but no other signs of habitation.

The wide ranging, delicate fungi-nets are too large and integrated into the soil to be moved off-planet, and since the Hidden Gardeners reproduce by 'splitting' into two consciousnesses when a Gardener grows too wide-ranging to have a decent thought-latency, there are no small, young individuals to take off planet.'''

SP_ACIREMA_DESC
'''Description
An Acirem is a 10-30 m ellipsoidal energy beings with large (30-100m) ''wings''. As they age they tend to accumulate material from around them developing a dusty and eventually rocky appearance (still maintaining the visible energy flows through their body and the gaps). Most Acirema live in a universe where the physical constants are slightly different, and there is only one place where they can get through to our universe, on their "Homeworld" of Portal. However, upon doing that they immediately begin to 'age' differently than in their own universe. Acirema cannot survive more than a few fractions of a galactic cycle in this universe. So an Acirem rarely spends much time before crossing back into their own universe.

As the Acirema found the anomaly that allowed them to enter into this universe, they also found that harnessing the differences in structure allowed them to generate energy in massive amounts in both universes. They also found that their bodies could release and manipulate massive amounts of energy. They rapidly began gathering material on Portal to study, and use to build structures on Portal itself. However that massive amount of energy meant they rapidly mined Portal out, and soon had very limited minerals that were safe for them to extract.

The massive amount of energy they can release as individuals and across the connection from Portal to their home universe, gives them the ability to produce large amounts of Industry, and also allows them to act as weapons. This makes Portal a very dangerous world to approach, as the Acirema are very wary of outsiders, and are sensitive to the vulnerability of their position. Trade with another universe is definitely beneficial, especially since they cannot obtain minerals from other planets. The Acirema on Portal seem to have a government that is similar to a military and/or research outpost (tightly controlled core with a majority loosely controlled) They are very secretive of the nature of their society back home.

Living Weapons:
Ships crewed by Acirema will gain a +1 bonus to their shields, even if the ship itself has no shield.

"Homeworld"
Portal is a Radiated world close to an unusually bright Blue Giant Star, with a connection to another universe. It is thought that Precursor testing may have opened the connection, and caused the star to change. There is suspicion that there may have been intelligent life on Portal, and they were destroyed by the Acirema when the connection opened (either due to research or advanced weapons use).

Reason for staying
They can't stay here long enough to actually move to another planet and still survive.'''

A giant serpentine swimmer, an Ourbools most distinctive feature is the massive bow curving away on either side of their head. This houses the gravi-sensory organs. Three tentacles hanging in front of the mouth allow Ourbools to manipulate their environment. Ourbools mate only once in their life, and devote the next 35 years to caring for the school of 5 to 7 young -- generally assisted by relatives. Ourbools live long so

Personality:
Ourbools are inclined to a nomadic life, hunting or herding their prey ichthyoids. Society focuses to a large degree on the proper and graceful interaction between two wandering groups that meet by chance.
A significant minority drop out of society and adopt sedentary lives bound by the practical requirements of their craft

Homeworld:
The homeworld, Oolur is orbited by 23 moons.

Reason for Staying:
The Ourbools find their sense of position via the regular movements of the 23 moons. Everything is perceived against that gravitational background. To be removed from that context is extremely disorienting to the point of "blinding" the unlucky traveler. He no longer has the familiar to calibrate against so all he can perceive is meaningless graviton noise.

The Volp-Uglush are an asexual species approximately 300 meters in length that live in tunnels on their homeworld. They subsist on silicates and have a vast number of short arm/mouth parts on the front of their thick cylindrical bodies that they use for manipulation/tunneling/eating and for sending messages through their tunnel network. In early historical times there were several different strains of Volp-Uglush but they were in constant conflict. Groups that successfully organized themselves were the best competers for resources, and as they moved from industrial to information age, one strain became dominant, and the remainder died out. The remaining strain began to optimize their homeworld for most efficient use of resources. They became incredibly adept at recognizing resource needs, as well as how societal structures affected individual behavior.
The Volp-Uglush society almost acts as a single organism, because society has been adapted to run so smoothly. However, this has led to a critical loss of independent function. While Volp-Uglush society is incredibly efficient, it would take individual Volp-Uglushs hundreds, if not thousands of years to be able to successfully develop a new independent society.

They are very effective at directing merchant fleets, and make excellent bureaucrats for creating changes in societies. While they have an incredibly efficient war machine, and are capable of individually taking on various large battle engines, the chaos of combat is not their most effective environment.

Homeworld:
Hive is a large Barren world that is ~2 times bigger than its mass and material would suggest as all of it but a small metal core has been converted through tunneling and building into the Vast tunnel network of the Volp-Uglush bureaucracy.

Reason for Staying:
Volp-Uglush are now too integrated and ingrown. They now totally lack the independence and innovation needed to leave Hive and start a new colony.

The Furthest believe that sapience is measured by the distance that a being can separate itself from danger. Thus the name " Furthest" describes their species as the most advanced of beings.

Indeed staying alert for threats, and hiding  are the core of their psychology and culture. The Furthest homeworld currently contains no carnivore they can't crush underfoot.

LRN_PHYS_BRAIN
The Physical Brain

LRN_PHYS_BRAIN_DESC
The structures and their functions in the brain are determined. The electrochemical and quantum nature of thought and memory are exposed. With understanding, alteration and augmentation of brain functions becomes possible, and new ideas are spawned at the frontiers of thought, its expression, and its replacement.

Lesser minds struggle with, or accept the confines of the language they have learned. Adequate minds reach and feel constrained by the concepts they are given ways to express. Truly great minds break free of the bounds of language, forming and analyzing thoughts that verge on the transcendental. But merely great minds are left isolated and futile, for without language to express thoughts, how can they share their insights?'''

While traditional computers have nearly unfathomable intelligence and computational abilities, they lack the essential qualities of self-awareness, consciousness or sentience. While these traits remain elusive, reasonable facsimiles may be produced. These investigations open new avenues of research into cognitive sciences and novel metaparadigms.

Nascent AIs can input all data discovered by active researchers into a single automatic data processing network, data can be analyzed and new data obtained by an entirely automated research facility. Each planet can contain such structures regardless of the population's occupations, giving a bonus to research on all worlds.'''

'''Allows discoveries from [[special ANCIENT_RUINS_SPECIAL]].

The contemporary empires, races and single-star civilizations are not the first or only beings to have lived in this galaxy. Remains, ruins and rumors of the ancients may be found on deserted planets and lifeless asteroids, or drifting in open space. Finding and deciphering such clues holds great potential to reveal secrets, teach lessons, or give warnings of ancient knowledge.

It is often exceedingly difficult and dangerous to decipher the clues left by ancient civilizations in the form of highly advanced technology. Mistreatment of the technology or accidental activation can cause the technology itself and/or the archaeologists extracting the technology to be lost. By containing the technology safely within a force field and probing its depths via non-local field manipulation, it is possible to safely recover and unlock the mysteries of ancient technology.'''

LRN_GRAVITONICS
Gravitonics

LRN_GRAVITONICS_DESC
Analogous to the "color charge" of quantum chromodynamics, there are several types of graviton. With the common attractive-force graviton, the colloquial "anti-graviton", "right-graviton" and "left-graviton" may be combined to bend and flex the surface of space-time arbitrarily. This manipulation is perceived as control of the force of gravity, permitting structures, craft and investigations previously impossible, even theoretically.

LRN_EVERYTHING
Theory of Everything

LRN_EVERYTHING_DESC
Early, naive theories describe subsets of the four fundamental forces of nature: electromagnetism, the strong and weak nuclear forces, and gravity. A complete framework expressing all forces as special cases of a single interaction represents a holy grail of science. This theory describes the earliest moments of the universe, the most distorted depths of a singularity, the tightest windings of hidden dimensions and the final fate of the cosmos. Yet still, there may "exist" layers of existence beyond what can be observed and described by science...

However, there can only be one active shield generator on a ship, so shield parts do not stack.

Like Fourier analysis of sound, electromagnetism, strong and weak forces may be expressed as harmonic quantum standing-wave superpositions of force-carrier particles. By selectively amplifying these harmonics, forces may be arbitrarily controlled to shield, attack, contain or support.'''

LRN_MIND_VOID
Mind of the Void

LRN_MIND_VOID_DESC
We are not alone in the cosmos... but why should the search be so limited? Many cultures have myths, legends or fervent belief in a higher consciousness. Whether a loving or malevolent God, or a detached observer, it is clear that something, perhaps the universe itself on some level, is alive, aware, watching.

LRN_TIME_MECH
Temporal Mechanics

LRN_TIME_MECH_DESC
What are "now", "future" and "past"? The twin paradox of special relativity, or the theoretical "wormhole" in its place, suggest early forms of "time travel". Direct manipulation of spacetime and temporal flux permit these effects to be harnessed and magnified. Temporal incursions cannot perceptibly alter the past of the universe that we perceive. They can, however, compress ages or extend moments to arbitrary durations, to uses limited only by the material supplies provided, and our own patience...

LRN_NDIM_SUBSPACE
N-Dimensional Subspace

LRN_NDIM_SUBSPACE_DESC
Early superstring theorists spoke of 10, 11 or 26 dimensional universes, with all but the 4 macrodimensions "curled up" so tightly as to be unseen. These and other dimensions may now be uncurled and opened, and the very surface of space itself stretched and pierced by shifting matter to or from levels of existence previously hidden below the surface of our limited perception, or creating layers or bubbles where none existed before.

LRN_UNIF_CONC
Unified Consciousness

LRN_UNIF_CONC_DESC
'''By transferring the mind into cyberspace, thousands of minds can act as one, their actions perfectly unified and directed towards the good of the whole.

Telepathic communication between individuals or mind-machine interfaces only permit the most basic, trivial and surface exchanges of thought and ideas. Truly joined minds function as a single consciousness, with the summed faculties and knowledge of its constituent parts, and acting as a new unique entity. This has great potential, but also significant risk, in that the union may not seek its own destruction, which is necessary for the original minds to be regained. Alternatively, one of the minds may dominate the other, controlling or destroying the other, rather than forming an equal, harmonious union.'''

A massive, empire-wide data network able to transfer information instantaneously between any two places, rather than via the lengthy and indirect path of starlanes. This advancement greatly facilitates research throughout the empire.

Every particle is inextricably connected on the quantum level to every particle with which it has previously interacted. Older mechanistic ideas about cause and effect do not apply on this level, and particles can "communicate" instantaneously across vast distances. When a thorough understanding of this phenomena is acquired, selective small-scale action-at-a-distance between any two points can be achieved instantaneously and outdated relativistic speed limits no longer apply to the transfer of information.'''

LRN_TRANSCEND
Singularity of Transcendence

LRN_TRANSCEND_DESC
What is godhood? Is a god concerned with whether it is moral and benevolent or evil and tyrannical? Does a god treat mortals with care and love, hatred and suffering or detached indifference? Does a god even remain aware of the infinitely minuscule affairs of the physical universe, or is true godhood of a form beyond description, of which inability to comprehend by mortals applies equally in the other direction?

'''Many diseases and injuries, or manifestations of the same disease or injury, can have very similar causes and symptoms, but very different ideal treatments. By treating each individual's illness according its specific manifestation rather than its general categorization, a general benefit to health can be obtained.
Treatment of diseases and injuries requires a thorough understanding of their causes. By studying the subtleties and intricacies of various ailments, it is possible to develop far more effective treatment methods.'''

GRO_PLANET_ECOL
Planetary Ecology

GRO_PLANET_ECOL_DESC
Agriculture and medical science can drastically increase survivability, allowing great increases in population and food production. Eventually, new limits to growth arise in the carrying capacity of a planet, and the interconnected web of life that supports it. Understanding natural ecology and its interaction to stresses permits the system to be modified and enhanced, and its benefits reaped for generations to come.

GRO_GENETIC_ENG
Genetic Engineering

GRO_GENETIC_ENG_DESC
'''The palette of genetics is as varied as the forms of life from which it borrows. Genes may be removed, copied and reinserted into genomes to create transgenic organisms with combinations of traits not existent or possible in nature. As well, genes may be altered prior to reinsertion, by altering the base codes directly, allowing entirely new genes to be created. Techniques are limited, however, to small modifications of existing genes that are available for study.'''

CON_REMOTE_COL

'''Traditional Genetic Engineering alters genetic codes, then grows the modified organism from an embryonic state. Similar techniques may be applied to already matured individuals. The goals of these treatments may be cosmetic, functional, corrective, preventative or life-saving medical treatments. Reducing the delay between alteration and results from generations to months, days or hours has a corresponding increase in the range and power of possible alterations.'''

GRO_LIFECYCLE_MAN
Lifecycle Manipulation

GRO_LIFECYCLE_MAN_DESC
'''Through chemical manipulation and cryonics, life processes may be halted without terminating them permanently. Beings in this state are preserved indefinitely, consume no resources and require very little storage - not living - space. With this technique, colonists can be transported much more efficiently, and the amount of colonists on a freshly built colony as well as the capacity of colony ships is greatly increased.

Most complex organisms progress through various physiological stages during a lifetime, whether distinctly separated by metamorphoses, or blurred by continuous slow aging. In many cases, one or more of these stages are, at least at a given time, more useful and desirable than others. By delicate control of hormonal or mental mechanisms, it becomes possible to drastically speed or slow each stage, permitting fully developed and functional individuals to be produced in a fraction of the natural timeframe, and for those individuals to remain functional indefinitely, becoming effectively immortal.'''

GRO_ADV_ECOMAN
Advanced Eco-Manipulation

GRO_ADV_ECOMAN_DESC
Even in an artificial environment, weather patterns and natural ecological cycles can get out of control, causing large amounts of damage. By introducing stabilizing factors, incidents of destructive ecological forces in artificial environments can be reduced, allowing large-scale environmental modifications.

GRO_XENO_GENETICS

The study of other life forms often exemplifies the weaknesses inherent in one's own species. By studying other life forms and using that knowledge to improve upon one's own genetic code, it is possible to develop many useful adaptations that would be otherwise impossible.

Early genetics is limited by the available samples of naturally occurring organisms on which to base its modifications. As well, these modifications are restricted within the limits of the physical mechanisms of genetic code storage, alteration and expression in developed individuals. By investigating the equivalent systems in entirely different ecosystems and organisms, great insights or revelations may be reached, spurring new developments in more familiar genetic systems.'''

GRO_NANOTECH_MED
Nanotech Medicine

GRO_NANOTECH_MED_DESC
'''Pathogens, particularly prokaryotes, are vulnerable to disruption of their genetic material from within - that is, if it is possible to permeate the cell membrane or the protein coating, in the case of viral infections. By designing nanorobots capable of identifying and penetrating such pathogens, it would be possible to destroy them by completely deconstructing their genetic material.

While genetic alteration can repair or undo the effects of harmful or undesired mutations or correct biochemical imbalances, treating major physical trauma and non-genetic congenital defects requires actual physical corrective measures. Nanotechnology may be used to accomplish these tasks, with two important advantages: Correction may be done without invasive surgeries and associated secondary damage and risks, and treatment reaction time is greatly reduced, as the tools to do the job are always in place and ready to function.'''

GRO_ECO_METAMORPH
Ecological Metamorphosis

GRO_ECO_METAMORPH_DESC
Often, it is helpful to think of an ecosystem as a gigantic organism in and of itself, with predator-prey relationships acting as negative feedback loops, with newly introduced species acting as symbiotes or parasites, with populations acting as systems and individuals acting as cells. In this sense, every planet is alive, and as such, goes through various phases of "life". By manipulating these phases as one would in a biological organism, it would be possible to affect a planets environment with comparative ease and efficiency.

GRO_XENO_HYBRIDS
Xenological Hybridization

GRO_XENO_HYBRIDS_DESC
'''Increases the max population of Poor planets by planet size; Tiny: +1, Small: +2, Medium: +3, Large: +4, Huge: +5, and Hostile planets by planet size; Tiny: +2, Small: +4, Medium: +6, Large: +8, Huge: +10

Often, the native fauna of a planet are far better suited to a planet's environment than any colonists who would try to inhabit it. These adverse effects can include anything from weather patterns to the planet's size. Through xenological hybridization, a genetically adapted form of the colonizing species can be developed with the advantageous traits of the native fauna, thus allowing more of the planet to be inhabited.

Regardless of how well understood, or how adeptly improved, a biological system is limited by its inherent nature. Structures and basic physiology can only be altered so far within the confines of a single planet's biology. With understanding of other biologies however, the disparate systems may be fused, forming an entirely new hybrid biology with potential abilities and traits greater than those of any of its parts.'''

GRO_NANO_CYBERNET
Nanotech Cybernetics

GRO_NANO_CYBERNET_DESC
After applying nanotechnology to internally correct defects or injuries, the next step is to augment or replace natural biochemical systems with superior artificial replacements. Rather than merely regrowing lost limbs or repairing damaged organs, augments are able to quickly grow new ones to suit their needs at any time. Antiquated biological systems, from muscle tissue and tendons, down to organelles or enzymes may also be replaced, affording greatly increased strength, endurance and flexibility.

GRO_TRANSORG_SENT
Trans-Organic Sentience

GRO_TRANSORG_SENT_DESC
Sentience as we know it is always observed as being inextricably tied to biological life. By grasping the true nature and origin of sentience itself, it would be possible to create conscious entities that could not possibly be classified as life as we know it.

While transforming an entire population into beings of pure energy would be impractical, certain tasks are better suited to individuals able to manifest themselves non-corporeally. Ship's crews for example, would no longer have to waste space with crew quarters or rations storage. Beings with greater energy channeling abilities would be able to enhance planetary shields and defense, and resource production would be generally enhanced.

PRO_MICROGRAV_MAN
Microgravity Industry

PRO_MICROGRAV_MAN_DESC
'''Increases [[encyclopedia INDUSTRY_TITLE]] by +5 on all Industry-focused colonies in system with an asteroid belt outposts or colonies. Additional claimed asteroid belts do not provide additional benefit.

Mineral resource extraction from sub-planetoid-sized bodies involves challenges and provides opportunities quite distinct from those of full-fledged planets. Lacking sufficient mass to self-liquefy and differentiate, asteroids can provide much easier access to some heavier elements, and lack of a gravity can make extraction for use in space much more efficient. Conversely, the limited size of each source asteroid requires fully portable self-sufficient extraction facilities. As well, the challenges of any microgravity environment must be overcome, requiring redesign of many traditional methods.

The microgravity of low planetary orbit offers great potential for novel manufacturing facility designs, equipment and techniques not possible on planet surfaces. Solids may be held in place with minimal support. Liquids and gases float freely, shaped only by surface tension, unless otherwise manipulated. Factory equipment may be arranged optimally in three dimensions. These conditions permit great increases in efficiency and productivity, if properly exploited.'''

PRO_CORE_MINE
Tectonic Mineralogy

PRO_CORE_MINE_DESC
'''Some sort of very aggressive mining goes here.

The pressure and temperatures in terrestrial planet mantles and cores create large quantities of crystal and mineral formations that appear on upper crust layers only due to volcanism. The lower atmospheric layers and core materials of gaseous planets contain even more exotic materials, in greater concentrations. Accessing these regions to extract the materials is difficult and treacherous, but eminently rewarding, compared to traditional surface mining activities.

Useful minerals are created throughout the volume of a planet, under various exacting chemical and thermodynamic conditions, including aqueous surface sedimentation, crushing core differentiation and mid-depth metamorphosis. After creation, processes such as plate tectonics, volcanism and deep convection currents are equally important in determining the final location and form of these extractable resources. Understanding these processes and their effects, causes and signs is essential for large scale efficient mining operations.'''

'''Increases target [[encyclopedia INDUSTRY_TITLE]] on all planets with the Industry focus by 0.1 per Population.

Exobots, as they become commonly known, are a marvel of form meets function. They are robots designed to fulfill nearly any manufacturing job, in fields as wide ranging as electronics to large-scale construction. Easily mass produced, they serve best on colonies that place a high priority on industry. Every world focused primarily on industry receives a team of Exobots, greatly increasing industrial production.

Although high level initial design and initial facility setup still require active supervision, the elimination of operators from the actual production process eliminates many bottlenecks. Robots work continuously, without perpetual demands for greater economic compensation. Robots have much greater tolerance for hazardous environmental conditions in the factory, and do not require additional habitable space off-site. Robots perform their assigned tasks flawlessly, or at least as well as they are instructed.'''

Fusion plants, while expensive to produce and maintain, easily pay for themselves on industrialized worlds with ever increasing power demands. Reliance on old fission based nuclear plants will gradually become a thing of the past.

Explosive or uncontrolled thermonuclear reactions are comparatively simple to cause at scales ranging from small tactical warheads to supergiant stellar furnaces. Controllable, stable and practical power generation from the reaction is somewhat more difficult. The process remains attractive, however, due to the near-limitless supply of fuel and potential for emissions-free operation.'''

PRO_NANOTECH_PROD
Nanotech Production

PRO_NANOTECH_PROD_DESC
Traditional production techniques are fundamentally limited by the size and form of the tools they employ. As a product takes form, its outer layers may prevent direct access and manipulation of the inner structure, requiring inconvenient and inefficient adjustment to the order of assembly. Furthermore, the components of a larger product must be carefully formed and assembled to exacting specifications to ensure they will function as intended when combined. By using nanotechnology to form a complete product in one step, directly from the stock materials, these limitations can be bypassed, dramatically improving efficiency and production speed.

PRO_ORBITAL_GEN
Orbital Generation

PRO_ORBITAL_GEN_DESC
'''Once troublesome gravity well problems are overcome, gas giants offer a unique opportunity to harvest usable energy quickly and efficiently. Methods which take advantage of the high density atmosphere and belt-zone circulation allow a significant amount of energy to be easily accrued and transported for use in nearby planets.

Low orbit of planetary bodies provides numerous benefits for power generation compared to planetary surfaces. Direct exposure to nearby solar radiation without atmospheric attenuation, and the orders of magnitude larger structures that may be assembled in microgravity to collect it are significant advantages. The resulting power may be used in orbit, or may be beamed to the planet to support surface industry. As well, new mechanisms of energy conversion become available in orbit, including planetary magnetic field coupling, orbital momentum exchange, and frictional heating with planetary atmospheres, which are uniquely beneficial for specialized applications.'''

By producing automated factories that operate without direct supervision, it is possible to increase industrial output in an entirely automated facility. These factories can be built and maintained on any planet, regardless of focus, providing a bonus to industry on all worlds.

As equipment becomes increasingly automated, it becomes capable of fully replicating and maintaining itself without outside support, other than its required raw materials and a requested, or suggested, final product to produce. When controlled by an artificial mind, the entire system can learn, plan, react, and adapt autonomously, and can do so without the cumbersome inefficiencies traditionally required to house and employ workers.'''

PRO_INTSTEL_COPRO
Interstellar Co-Production

PRO_INTSTEL_COPRO_DESC
Traditional means of production are limited by the necessity of self-sufficiency due to transportation and other logistical problems. Later developments in planetary regional cooperation permit some degree of specialization and co-operation, with each facility producing only a few parts or subsystems, and the whole system benefiting from concentrated expertise and economy of scale. Expanding this concept several orders of magnitude, it may adapted to a galactic scale, with individual planets or entire systems functioning in the role of the single specialized facility. The logistical difficulties inherent in this paradigm are also similar to those of the earlier iteration, and are scaled up to the same degree as the potential benefits.

PRO_NDIM_ASSMB
N-Dimensional Assembly

PRO_NDIM_ASSMB_DESC
'''Once the greatest fear of N-dimensional physicists, now the noblest goal - to deliberately create a hyperspatial rift between our universe and the next, but inside a dimensional bubble, safely separate from known space-time. Once this is accomplished, it would be a relatively simple matter to tap into the enormous flow of energy that would travel across the rift.

The geometry of physical space has always been a major impediment to the assembly of objects within that space. Objects cannot be collocated, and volumes cannot be simultaneously enclosed and open if their existence is restricted to a mere three dimensions. Moving beyond this limitation, parts of objects can be folded out of the way in a pocket dimensions, and contiguous lines may be passed around other masses by going "off-axis". Similar mechanisms are also used to assemble lower-dimensional objects in configurations that would be impossible without higher-dimensional pathways.'''

PRO_SINGULAR_GEN
Singularity Generation

PRO_SINGULAR_GEN_DESC
'''Harnessing energy from a black hole is significantly more dangerous than harnessing energy from a regular star, but also has potential for significantly greater gains. By building a generator designed to tap into the energy of particle-antiparticle collisions on the event horizon of a singularity, tremendous benefits to industry may be obtained.

As matter is drawn towards a singularity by the intense space-time curvature, or gravitational field, the matter forms an accretion disk and is greatly compressed and heated. High energy radiation emitted from the disk may be captured and harnessed for power generation. The event horizon of the singularity itself also emits radiation due to the annihilation of virtual particle-antiparticle pairs that form in its vicinity. This method of power generation is significantly more delicate and unstable than the accretion disk method, but can produce an even greater output.'''

PRO_ZERO_GEN
Zero-Point Generation

PRO_ZERO_GEN_DESC
'''Any power generation mechanism that involves a material fuel supply is limited by the relativistic mass-energy relationship: no more energy can be produced than equivalent mass consumed, even with perfect efficiency. By tapping the inherent energy of the vacuum, or zero-point energy, an effectively infinite source is made available. The rate, or power, of this extraction is also theoretically unbounded, with limits only in the available means to collect and use the output.

At appropriate scales and under specific conditions, matter-energy becomes a unified phenomenon. Applied at larger scales, complete control over the structure of matter and the dynamics of energy becomes possible, as does the interchange between the two. Transmutation and replication, at limited scales, become possible. However, despite the enormous rest mass energy equivalence of matter, converting directly to energy for bulk power generation is generally less effective than comparatively simple fusion generation.

Previous production techniques were essentially ways to avoid or remove particularly vexing problems with manipulation of matter. None of these techniques fundamentally changed the basic method however, which was to assemble larger objects out of supplied materials, be they prefabricated subsections, or raw minerals. By converting pure energy directly into the desired material object, the need for supplied materials such as minerals or food can become greatly reduced in times of necessity.'''

CON_ARCH_PSYCH_DESC
The form of a structure or inhabited space is not merely guided by the physical limitations of the materials from which it is constructed.

Actual living structures, however, can be grown into their final shape with no additional labour, as well effect some degree of self-repair when damaged. They may also naturally self-regulate their internal environments, or potentially adapt to varied or changing surroundings as necessary, during or after their initial growth.

A shutter functions as both a solid wall and open window, according to the desire of its user. A room may be refurnished to serve an entirely new purpose, within the limits of the space available. This concept may also be extended to the actual form and structure of an entire building or city, whether mechanical or organic. Eliminating the need for demolition and rebuilding permits much greater infrastructure flexibility and efficiency. Single or isolated structures may also serve many purposes simultaneously, that would previously have required much larger and elaborate fixed designs.'''

CON_ARCH_MONOFILS
Architectural Monofilaments

CON_ARCH_MONOFILS_DESC
Essentially unbreakable and merely a few atoms in diameter, single-crystal filaments have many uses in improving traditional structure designs in durability and economy of construction. The capacity to suspend or stress other materials in previously impossible configurations also permits a wholly new designs. Low weight and high strength filaments are of particular use in large-scale orbital or surface to orbit spanning structures, where variations in gravity across lengths were previously very prohibitive.

CON_ASYMP_MATS
Asymptotic Materials

CON_ASYMP_MATS_DESC
Once certain thresholds of performance are passed, measuring the physical properties of materials for relative comparison becomes impractical in any terms other than orders of magnitude or logarithmic scales. Much like superconductivity in electronics, the tensile strength, toughness, density, elasticity, refractory index and other mechanical properties of materials may be controlled with effectively no limits. With all previously significant limitations removed, structure designs are further unhindered, and may extend or change by similar order of magnitude scales.

CON_FRC_ENRG_STRC
Force-Energy Structures

CON_FRC_ENRG_STRC_DESC
'''Increases the growth of resource meters below target value to 3 per turn, and the decay of resource meters above target value to 5 per turn.

The flexibility and versatility of force-energy structures permits a colonies buildings to be more easily re-tooled to suit new purposes, increasing the rate at which focus changes can take effect.

When forces and energy can be manipulated as desired to provide the same functionality as solid surfaces, there is no essential need to have physical materials enclosing the occupants of a building. Structures composed entirely of energy have many advantages, including simple reconfiguration, resilience, portability and novel design possibilities.'''

CON_CONTGRAV_ARCH
Gravitic Architecture

CON_CONTGRAV_ARCH_DESC
'''Increases the [[encyclopedia SUPPLY_TITLE]] line range of all colonies and outposts by 1.

By installing a massive null gravity generator at a planet's core, it becomes possible to turn a planet's gravity on or off like a light switch, but in a narrow well. The planet's industry then gains all the benefits of low-G and zero-G, but without the drawbacks. Reverse gravity wells can also be created, making space launches cost practically nothing.

By fully controlling the orientation and strength of gravitational forces acting upon and existent within a structure, designs may simultaneously exhibit the freedom of weightlessness and the utility of having a defined up and down. The structure itself, and the local environments it seeks to provide, may take any shape in space, extending to great lengths, looping about itself, and making arbitrary interconnections. Simultaneously, local environments within may be infused with a useful tug, which may vary from or be entirely different from immediately adjacent areas. Such versatility permits great new functional designs for social, manufacturing or other uses.'''

CON_GAL_INFRA
Galactic Infrastructure

CON_GAL_INFRA_DESC
'''Increases the [[encyclopedia SUPPLY_TITLE]] line range of all colonies and outposts by 1.

The consistent and effective transportation of resources over large interstellar distances requires laborious planning, and is complicated by numerous factors such as the presence of space monsters, enemy empires and dangerous interstellar phenomena. By utilizing integrated galactic infrastructure, the fluid deployment of resources between advanced and developing colonies can be achieved, and solutions can be found to particularly troubling logistical problems.

Integration and development of the infrastructures on highly productive worlds into a unified galaxy-spanning network is one of the greatest logistical effort conceivable. When completed, such a system functionally unifies the worlds of which it is composed. Integrated transportation, housing, maintenance, and construction tools may be fluidly deployed wherever needed to optimally alter resource allocations or adjust to changes.'''

CON_ART_HEAVENLY
Artificial Heavenly Bodies

CON_ART_HEAVENLY_DESC
When roughly the mass of a small moon or larger, it is no longer sufficient to conceive of what is wrought as a "structure", "station" or "ship". Rather, beyond this scale, the object becomes more like a heavenly body; its gravitational pull influences orbital motions, it may retain an thin atmosphere on its surface, and it may be orbited by, rather than orbiting with, lesser structures. At even larger scales, entire planets may be built, or rebuilt, or even new stars may be formed and ignited, broadcasting the power and determination of their creators throughout the universe.

CON_TRANS_ARCH
Transcendent Architecture

CON_TRANS_ARCH_DESC
'''Mastering advanced orbital construction techniques, scientists create methods to enable construction of the awe inspiring Megalith.

The epitome of design unifies optimal functionality with elegance of form. A transcendent structure expands and inspires the minds of its occupants or observers with its shape, placement, substance and integration, whether through awe-inspiring scale, perfect emphasis of a single idea, perception or lack thereof, or utter simplicity and fitness for purpose.'''

CON_ORBITAL_HAB
Orbital Habitation

CON_ORBITAL_HAB_DESC
'''Increases Population capacity by planet size on all habitable planets; Tiny: +1, Small: +2, Medium: +3, Large: +4, Huge: +5.'''

CON_NDIM_STRC
N-Dimensional Structures

CON_NDIM_STRC_DESC
'''Increases Population capacity by planet size on all habitable planets; Tiny: +2, Small: +4, Medium: +6, Large: +8, Huge: +10.

The primary limiting factors on a planets population capacity are environmental desirability and space. By phasing basic infrastructure development into multiple dimensions, spatial limitations are all but eliminated, and under ideal environmental conditions, the maximum population of a planet can be greatly increased.

Of all the bizarre feats of applied physics, the ability to to fold space onto itself has the most direct and profound influence on structural form and design. The potential is endless, literally as hallways are made to bend back upon their beginning, or given a twist so that their ceiling becomes their floor. As well, the concept of urban sprawl becomes laughable, as any number of people may fit into an arbitrarily small volume, safely tucked into an adjacent plane of existence.'''

SHP_GAL_EXPLO
Galactic Exploration

SHP_GAL_EXPLO_DESC
The discovery of interstellar travel via starlanes ushers in a new era of development of society. Old political squabbles between minor factions become insignificant when the entire civilization is faced with the limitless potential of the stars... for growth and prosperity, or utter destruction.

SHP_SPACE_TACTICS
Space Tactics

SHP_SPACE_TACTICS_DESC
Battles in microgravity and vacuum require specialized weapon and defensive systems, as well as the theoretical tactics that motivate their use.

SHP_INTSTEL_LOG
Interstellar Logistics

SHP_INTSTEL_LOG_DESC
'''Unlocks the Logistics focus setting, which increases the [[encyclopedia SUPPLY_TITLE]] of planets by 3.

Increases Starlane Speed of your ships by 20 when they are within 50 uu of a controlled planet.

Effectively supplying ships, ordering general fleet movement and even organizing the movement of specific ships in battle requires a complex understanding of navigation and detection, and of methods of information acquisition.'''

SHP_MIL_ROBO_CONT
Military Robotic Control

SHP_MIL_ROBO_CONT_DESC
Robotic control can be used effectively for tasks such as mining and industry; the natural extension of this concept is to develop military robotic equipment capable of independently operating a starship. This would allow greater versatility in design, as the necessity for bulky life-support systems would be removed. Hulls produced with such technology could also perform dangerous repairs without thought for the safety and biological limitations of living engineers.

SHP_SPACE_FLUX_DRIVE
Spatial Flux Drive

SHP_SPACE_FLUX_DRIVE_DESC
Ordinarily, propulsion in space is limited to either propellant or field propulsion. On relatively small scales however, it is possible to propel an object in space much like one could in water: by pushing backwards the medium in which the object is immersed. This requires the manipulation of space itself whereby the smallest units of space are collapsed, forcing the matter they once contained into adjacent units of space. This method of propulsion is very efficient, but dangerous on larger scales and easily detectable due to the dimensional effects.

SHP_CONTGRAV_MAINT
Contra Gravitational Maintenance

SHP_CONTGRAV_MAINT_DESC
When the mass of the ship surpasses a certain threshold, it becomes necessary to consider the gravitational stresses on vital architectural points in the ship's structure. These points will be unable to withstand the gravitational stresses and collapse, destroying the vessel. This necessitates nearly constant maintenance of these points to avoid total structural failure.

SHP_NANOROBO_MAINT
Nano-Robotic Maintenance

SHP_NANOROBO_MAINT_DESC
Just as nanorobots can be used for production, so also can they be used for maintenance. A hull with a complement of centrally organized nanite engineers would be able to rapidly repair damage, even during combat. Such machines would have great difficulty distinguishing organic beings from a part of the hull in need of repair however, and as such this concept could only be applied to automated hulls.

SHP_MASSPROP_SPEC
Mass Propulsion Specialization

SHP_MASSPROP_SPEC_DESC
Traditional propulsion devices operate well on objects of relatively low mass. However, when the mass of a ship approaches that of a small moon, ordinary methods of propulsion are very clumsy and require tremendous amounts of energy. A new approach to propulsion, taking into account the size of the object in question as a fundamental aspect of the system, could allow such vessels to have useful mobility.

SHP_TRANSSPACE_DRIVE
Trans-Spatial Drive

SHP_TRANSSPACE_DRIVE_DESC
Even when spatial dimensions are skewed by relativistic effects, an object generally has constant space-time characteristics. By creating a device which alters the characteristics of space-time itself using quasi-relativistic effects, it would be possible to create a fast, stealthy method of propulsion. 

SHP_MIDCOMB_LOG
Mid-Combat Logistics

SHP_MIDCOMB_LOG_DESC
When interstellar fleets are in regular, commonplace use, the transfer of personnel and material in the absence of enemy ships is a relatively trivial task. In combat however, when such transfers could potentially have great tactical merit, there is great difficulty with the co-ordinational aspects of logistics due to the possibility of sudden changes in the tactical scenario. By using a single mobile command station, it is possible to organize and enact logistic patterns in the midst of combat.

SHP_ASTEROID_HULLS
Asteroid Hulls

SHP_ASTEROID_HULLS_DESC
Rather than constructing a hull from scratch, it is far easier to take a pre-existing space-borne object and adapt it to fill the role of a ship's hull. Not only would such ships be very inexpensive to produce, but they would also be able to avoid detection by enemy ships by hiding amongst other asteroids.

SHP_HEAVY_AST_HULL
Heavy Asteroid Hulls

SHP_HEAVY_AST_HULL_DESC
Allows construction of larger asteroid hulls

SHP_ASTEROID_REFORM
Asteroid Reformation

SHP_ASTEROID_REFORM_DESC
Through advanced processing of asteroid bodies rock armor can be produced which is as cheap as but more durable than lead armor plating.

SHP_MONOMOLEC_LATTICE
Monomolecular Latticing

SHP_MONOMOLEC_LATTICE_DESC
Asteroid Hulls can be reinforced and armor plated, but the fact remains that the basic substance of which most asteroids are primarily composed is of lesser strength than most modern alloys. However, if the molecular structure of the rock itself were to be rearranged into a crystal lattice, its strength could be increased tremendously, allowing the production of asteroid hulls of previously impossible strengths.

SHP_MULTICELL_CAST
Multi-Cellular Casting

SHP_MULTICELL_CAST_DESC
Even when it is inert, organic material is much more versatile than standard materials. A non-living multi-cellular ship would provide some of the advantages of organic materials without the customary nuisances of organic life.

SHP_DOMESTIC_MONSTER
Domesticated Mega-Fauna

SHP_DOMESTIC_MONSTER_DESC
'''Though huge and alien the time-tested arts of domestication can also be applied to the space monsters that travel the starlanes. Building Colonies or Outposts at monster nests will enable the raising of domesticated monsters.'''

SHP_ENDOCRINE_SYSTEMS
Mega-Fauna Endocrine Systems

SHP_ENDOCRINE_SYSTEMS_DESC
The study of space-faring organisms' endocrine systems allows for the expansion of organic ships' internal structures.

SHP_HAB_MEGAFAUN
Habitable Mega-Fauna

SHP_HAB_MEGAFAUN_DESC
It is generally uncommon to find comfortable living conditions within a gigantic space monster. This is exactly what must exist within an organic hull however, if it is to be adequately controlled from within. The development of massive, habitable creatures opens up numerous possibilities for ship design.

SHP_MONOCELL_EXP
Mono-Cellular Expansion

SHP_MONOCELL_EXP_DESC
Multi-cellular organisms tend to have longer life spans than single celled organisms due to specialization and interdependency. However, with the appropriate technological refinements, these aspects of multi-cellular life can be applied to a massive mono-cellular organism, allowing it to have practical functionality in combat.

SHP_CONT_SYMB
Contrived Symbiosis

SHP_CONT_SYMB_DESC
Any ship's hull is in a symbiotic relationship with its makers in that they bring it into being and sustain it, and it performs its desired functions. However, this is a purely behavioral type of symbiosis. Through careful planning and design, an organic ship can be made to have a biological symbiotic relationship with its crew, each providing the other with the essentials of life.

SHP_CONT_BIOADAPT
Controlled Ravenous Bioadaption

SHP_CONT_BIOADAPT_DESC
It is very difficult to predict the actions of a living being to any useful degree of certainty without having an intimate understanding of its behavioral patterns. By placing a life form under harshly competitive developmental conditions, its behavioral patterns can be manipulated, strengthened and effectively utilized in war.

SHP_BIOADAPTIVE_SPEC
Bio-Neural Specialization

SHP_BIOADAPTIVE_SPEC_DESC
As a species evolves mental capabilities, the individuals whose minds are not perfectly attuned to the needs of their bodies cannot compete with those whose minds are perfectly specialized for their bodies. Thus, all evolved life forms have nearly ideal mental development for their type of body. There are no such guarantees for artificial life forms however, and often the true potential of such a being is unrealized due to subtle incompatibilities between mind and body. By specializing the organism's neural patterns to conform to its body type, these incompatibilities can be eliminated.

SHP_FRC_ENRG_COMP
Force-Energy Compression

SHP_FRC_ENRG_COMP_DESC
Typically, the manipulation of energy requires it to be in the form of matter so that potential energy can be stored as desired and released on demand. Matter converted to pure energy stored in the fabric of space-time itself would be more versatile than any material substance, but impossible to contain without advanced force-field technology.

SHP_QUANT_ENRG_MAG
Quantum Energy Magnification

SHP_QUANT_ENRG_MAG_DESC
'''Due to quantum uncertainty, it is possible for a particle to arbitrarily gain a small amount of energy or for new particles to temporarily enter existence. By detecting and magnifying these fluctuations in quantum energy, it would be possible to tremendously increase the capabilities of an energy hull.'''

SHP_ENRG_BOUND_MAN
Energy Boundary Manipulation

SHP_ENRG_BOUND_MAN_DESC
'''Whether constructed, grown, or adapted from a pre-existing structure, ships composed of matter must have a logical and co-ordinated structure to allow even basic utility. Pure energy however, has no such restrictions. This allows a pure energy hull to take on any form whatsoever, however impractical it would be from a material standpoint.
'''

SHP_SOLAR_CONT
Solar Containment

SHP_SOLAR_CONT_DESC
'''A hull constructed from pure energy, while far more versatile than a solid hull, has a disadvantage in that it is unable to harness the potential energy of material objects. If, however, it were made possible to contain a hull composed not of pure energy, but of super-heated gases constantly undergoing a self-sustaining fusion reaction, the limitations of both pure energy and solid matter could be avoided.'''

'''Increases the [[encyclopedia SUPPLY_TITLE]] line range of all colonies and outposts by 1.

On a planet, there is always a fixed reference direction: "up". Microgravity is effectively isotropic. This single difference has a multitude of consequences for the types of structures that can be built, and which of those forms is the optimal use of space, materials and energy in each environment. As well, the interior configuration of spaces in orbit must be rethought. However, while it is appealing to attempt to completely revolutionize interior design in a paradigm completely independent of the styles used on planet surfaces, the practical use of these spaces will be initial primarily by those who are used to, and adapted for, those planet surfaces. Rather than a complete break from older styles, a gradual transition may be more effective.'''

CON_CONC_CAMP
Concentration Camps

CON_CONC_CAMP_DESC
Typically, when forced to work to death, citizens will put up some resistance and have the sympathy and support of outside observers. However, by carefully creating buildings designed to quench the fire of justice within outsiders, and to promote feelings of worthlessness and subservience in those on the inside, concentration camps can be effectively utilized without fear of revolt.

A force field does not, of necessity, possess these features in any permanent sense, and can be turned on and off or changed from one color to another at will. While most buildings are easily visible far away with a powerful detection apparatus, a force-energy structure - or a regular structure surrounded by a series of camouflage force-fields - would be essentially invisible from great distances.'''

CON_PLANET_DRIVE
Planetary Starlane Drive

CON_PLANET_DRIVE_DESC
Planets in the outermost systems of an empire are often in great danger of attack from enemy fleets, yet these planets can often contain extremely valuable resources and specials. By equipping an entire planet with the means to open and navigate a starlane, it would be possible to move such planets to a safer location in times of necessity.

CON_STARGATE
Stargate

CON_STARGATE_DESC
Particularly in more expansive empires, the need to move ships to a specific defensive location in great haste often exceeds the feasibility. By creating a warp between two or more points in space-time, it can be made possible to move ships even across an entire empire at need, allowing new offensive and defensive strategies.

CON_ART_PLANET
Artificial Planet

CON_ART_PLANET_DESC
'''Gas giants and asteroid belts offer unique opportunities and resources, not only as sites for acquiring valuable - and on occasion extremely rare - resources, but as raw materials in and of themselves for the production of artificial planets. Such planets would offer new centers for production in previously empty or entirely occupied systems.

The unknown variables in genomic calculations for any given species remain severe for all but the simplest genetic repairs, not to mention the changes that a genetic modification can potentially have on a larger multi-species biosphere. To truly realize the benefits of genetic medicine, it is necessary to collect a massive genome database for all the species from all known worlds.

GRO_INDUSTRY_CLONE
Industrial Cloning

GRO_INDUSTRY_CLONE_DESC
Primitive manual nuclear transfer cloning techniques are little more than novelties for large organisms. By applying techniques similar to industrial mass production or biochemical process engineering, it becomes possible to generate dozens, or millions, of full-grown copies of a single genetic blueprint. Populations may be made to order, tailored to meet the specific needs of society.

GRO_TERRAFORM
Terraforming

GRO_TERRAFORM_DESC
Changing the environmental type of a planet is a massive undertaking, the challenge of this process is to a large degree logistical. The precise method depends greatly on the type of planet to be changed and the desired result. However, in all cases much of the surface of the entire planet and its atmosphere needs to be converted to other types of molecules, vented into space or buried under the crust. As such, this process requires most of the planet to be accessible to the terraformers, and cannot be performed on a world with max population less than one.

GRO_TERRAFORM_SHORT_DESC
Allows terraforming

GRO_REMOTE_TERRAFORM
Remote Terraforming

GRO_REMOTE_TERRAFORM_DESC
Traditional terraforming methods treat the planet as a structure and attempt to alter its environment through physical and chemical means. This necessitates that the majority of the planet be accessible to the terraforming species, which generally limits its usefulness. By treating the planet as an organism and altering its physiology indirectly, it is possible to make use of less labour intensive, though more time consuming terraforming methods, allowing outposts on poor and hostile worlds to make use of terraforming.

GRO_GAIA_TRANS
Gaia Transformation

GRO_GAIA_TRANS_DESC
Theoretically, it is possible to completely predict the ecology of a single planet by mapping out its entire web of biological interdependence, both sentient and non-sentient, in fractal algorithms. In practice however, this could only be realized by constructing a vast planet-spanning network running a computer program dedicated to regulating the planet's entire biosphere. This computer would become, in effect, the brain of a new type of life - a single planetary organism, with intelligent citizens as part of its fabric, subject to the greater will.

GRO_GAIA_TRANS_SHORT_DESC

LRN_OBSERVATORY_I

LRN_OBSERVATORY_I_DESC
Studying and understanding the nature of stars and their internal and external attributes provides powerful insight into the nature of stellar phenomena and planetary bodies. Furthermore, fractal algorithms can be employed to decipher the dispersal of starlanes throughout the galaxy, allowing any stars which are in some way connected, however indirectly, to the known network of starlanes to be identified an monitored.

LRN_SOLAR_MAN
Solar Manipulation

LRN_SOLAR_MAN_DESC
Different star types not only have their own distinct attributes and opportunities for exploitation, but also tend to give rise to a particular planet type. Often, a star of a particular type will give a desired bonus, but will almost certainly be devoid of any desirable planets, or will not be present in an opportune location in the galaxy. By manipulating the high-energy reactions within a star's core, it would be possible to either reverse or accelerate the natural processes within the star, allowing it to be changed to an entirely different type at need.

When increased minerals production is the only concern, no environmental damage considerations exist and the environment itself is conducive, partially automated bulk mining activities can be optimal. Heavy mining processors are expensive however, and are only practical to use on worlds with primary focus mining. As well, these processors severely damage the ecology of a planet, reducing its maximum population somewhat.

PRO_SOL_ORB_GEN

Only one replication focus can take effect in the empire at one time.'''

BLD_PLANET_DRIVE
Planetary Starlane Drive

BLD_PLANET_DRIVE_DESC
'''Allows a planet to move between star systems. An interstellar lighthouse is required within 200 uu of the target system to allow the planet to proceed safely. Otherwise, the planet will have a 50% chance of being destroyed in transit. This is a hazardous journey even if the planet survives however, and only half the population of a planet will live even with support from the interstellar lighthouse. This building can be built at an outpost, but not on an asteroid belt.

Due to a lack of UI targeting, a second building is currently required on the other end of the starlane. This building will destroy itself immediately, so that the planet can move to a different target system later.

To use this building, set the planet to Planet Drive focus, and construct a Planetary Beacon in an adjacent system. The planet will then be moved to that system.'''
