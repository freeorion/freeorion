# To minimize potential conflict with stringtable tags, all keys here should begin with "FUNCTIONAL_"


## FUNCTIONAL_PRODUCTION_QUEUE_FRONTLOAD_FACTOR and FUNCTIONAL_PRODUCTION_QUEUE_TOPPING_UP_FACTOR specify settings that affect how the ProductionQueue will limit
## allocation towards building a given item on a given turn.  The base amount of maximum allocation per turn (if the player has enough PP available) is the item's total
## cost, divided over its minimum build time.  Sometimes complications arise, though, which unexpectedly delay the completion even if the item had been fully-funded 
## every turn, because costs have risen partway through (such as due to increasing ship costs resulting from recent ship constructoin completion and ensuing increase 
## of Fleet Maintenance costs.  These two settings provide a mechanism for some allocation leeway to deal with mid-build cost increases without causing the project 
## completion to take an extra turn because of the small bit of increased cost.  The settings differ in the timing of the extra allocation allowed.
## Both factors have a minimum value of 0.0 and a maximum value of 0.3.

## Making the frontloaded factor greater than zero increases the per-turn allocation cap by the specified percentage (so it always spreads the extra allocation across all turns).
## Making the topping-up option nonzero allows the final turn allocation cap to be increased by the specified percentage of the total cost, if needed (and then subject to 
## availability of course). They can both be nonzero, although to avoid that introducing too much interaction complexity into the minimum build time safeguard for topping-up, 
## the topping-up percentage will be reduced by the frontloading setting. 

## Note that for very small values of the options (less than 5%), when dealing with very low cost items the effect/protection may be noticeably less than expected because of
## interactions with the ProductionQueue Epsilon value (0.01)
