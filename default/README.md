# Resource directory (default)

The contents of the resource directory define the assets available to
FreeOrion, as well as logic for modifiable content.
These assets determine the appearance and functionality of FreeOrion.

While much of the content within this directory is required in any resource
directory, most is either
* required only from inclusion in other entries
* strictly optional

Each sub-directory has an accompanying README file within it.
This file should give a guideline for any entries or files required by
FreeOrion if a new resource directory is created.

An alternate resource directory can be specified with the
--resource-dir command line flag, or by changing the resource-dir node in the
user's config.xml.
See http://www.freeorion.org/index.php/Config.xml for details on the config.xml
file.
