## DesignWnd Redundant Part Filtering
## Default settings will deem a first part redundant to a second only if the second is all of (i) more powerful,
## (ii) no more expensive, (iii) takes no longer to build, and (iv) has no Location restrictions not also required
## by the first part (note that the checking on this point is currently over-conservative).
## Adjusting the Max Cost Ratio above 1.0 allows the filtering to consider a superior part which might cost a bit
## more, but whose Capacity/Cost ratio is at least equal to the Min Bargain Ratio.  For example, with the current content
## as of the time of this writing, setting the Max Cost Ratio to 2.1 and leaving the Min Bargain Ratio at 1.0 woould cause
## Zortrium armor to suppress Standard armor, and for Advanced Ground Troop Pods to suppress Standard Troop Pods.  Then
## also increasing the Max Time Ratio to 1.4 or higher would cause N-Dimensional Engines to suppress Improved Engine Couplings.
## Dropping the Max Cost Ratio below 2.0, or increasing the Min Bargain Ratio above 1.0, would prevent the redundancy filtering
## for troop Pods.  If the Min Bargain Ratio were no higher than about 1.2 and the Max Cost Ratio at least about 1.4, then
## some of the armor redundancy filtering would still occur.
## Both settings have a minimum value of 1.0

## Some parts have special Effects and so may be preferred to be excluded from the redundancy
## checks, which do not consider such Effects.  Parts on this list will be excluded from Redundancy checks.
## The SH_MULTISPEC shield part is one such part; it as a strong stealth Effect, but unless excluded
## here the Black Shield can suppress it as redundant.

## FUNCTIONAL_SITREP_PRIORITY_ORDER is an ordered, whitespace separated list, prioritizing
## these sitreps to be presented in the SitrepPanel in the order set below.
## Sitreps not specified below will appear in the SitrepPanel following those below.
## Sitreps should be placed with similar existing Sitreps as appropriate.  The
## entries will not work correctly if they contain spaces; use underscores "_" instead.
