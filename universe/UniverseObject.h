/** The abstract base class for all objects in the universe
  * The UniverseObject class itself has an ID number, a name, a position, an ID
  * of the system in which it is, a list of zero or more owners, and other
  * common object data.
  * Position in the Universe can range from 0 (left) to 1000 (right) in X, and
  * 0 (top) to 1000 (bottom) in Y.  This coordinate system was chosen to help
  * with conversion to and from screen coordinates, which originate at the
  * upper-left corner of the screen and increase down and to the right.  Each
  * UniverseObject-derived class inherits several pure virtual members that
  * perform its actions during various game phases, such as the movement phase.
  * These subclasses must define what actions to perform during those phases.
  * UniverseObjects advertise changes to themselves via the StateChanged
  * Signal.  This means that all mutators on UniverseObject and its subclasses
  * need to emit this signal.  This is how the UI becomes aware that an object
  * that is being displayed has changed.*/
