/** \brief Displays a piece of text.

    TextControl's know how to center, left- or right-justify, etc. themselves
    within their window areas.  The format flags used with TextControl are
    defined in the TextFormat flag type. TextControl has std::string-like
    operators and functions that allow the m_text member string to be
    manipulated directly.  In addition, the << and >> operators allow
    virtually any type (int, float, char, etc.) to be read from a TextControl
    object as if it were an input or output stream, thanks to
    boost::lexical_cast.  Note that the TextControl stream operators only read
    the first instance of the specified type from m_text, and overwrite the
    entire m_text string when writing to it; both operators may throw.

    <br>TextControl is based on pre-rendered font glyphs.  The text is
    rendered character by character from a prerendered font. The font used is
    gotten from the GUI's font manager.  Since a shared_ptr to the font is
    kept, the font is guaranteed to exist at least as long as the TextControl
    object that refers to it.  This also means that if the font is explicitly
    released from the font manager but is still held by at least one
    TextControl object, it will not be destroyed, due to the shared_ptr.  Note
    that if "" is supplied as the font_filename parameter, no text will be
    rendered, but a valid TextControl object will be constructed, which may
    later contain renderable text. TextControl objects support text with
    formatting tags. See GG::Font for details.*/
