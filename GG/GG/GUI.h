/** \brief An abstract base for an GUI framework class to drive the GG GUI.

    This class has all the essential services that GG requires: 
    - GUI initialization and emergency exit
    - GG event handling
    - rendering of GUI windows
    - entry into and cleanup after a "2D" mode, in case the app also uses non-orthographic 3D projections
    - registration into, removal from, and movement within a z-ordering of windows, including handling of "always-on-top" windows
    - handling of modal windows
    - drag-and-drop support
    - inter-frame time updates and FPS calculations
    - limits on FPS speed
    - access to the dimensions of the application window or screen
    - mouse state information
    - keyboard accelerators
    - management of fonts and textures

    <p>The user is required to provide several functions.  The most vital
    functions the user is required to provide are: Enter2DMode(),
    Exit2DMode(), DeltaT(), PollAndRender() [virtual private], and Run()
    [virtual private].  Without these, GUI is pretty useless.  In addition,
    HandleEvent() must be driven from PollAndRender().  The code driving
    HandleEvent() must interact with the hardware and/or operating system, and
    supply the appropriate EventType's, key presses, and mouse position info
    to HandleEvent().  It is the author's recommendation that the user use the
    provided SDL driver to do this.

    <p>Keyboard accelerators may be defined, as mentioned above.  Each defined
    accelerator has its own signal which is emitted each time the accelerator
    is detected.  Client code should listen to the appropriate signal to act
    on an accelerator invocation.  Each slot that is signalled with a keyboard
    accelerator should return true if it processed the accelerator, or false
    otherwise.  This lets GUI know whether or not it should create a keystroke
    event and process it normally, sending it to the Wnd that currently has
    focus.  Note that since signals can be connected to multiple slots, if
    even one slot returns true, no kestroke event is created.  It is perfectly
    legal to return false even if an accelerator is processed, as long as you
    also then want the focus Wnd to receive a keystroke event.  Also, note
    that all accelerators are processed before, and possbily instead of, any
    key events.  So setting a plain "h" as a keyboard accelerator can (if it
    is processed normally by a slot) prevent any Wnd anywhere in your
    application from receiving "h" keystrokes.  To avoid this:
    - Define accelerators with modifier keys like CTRL and ALT, or
    - Have slots that process these accelerators return false, or
    - Do not connect anything to such an accelerator, in which case it will return false.

    <p>A GUI-wide StyleFactory can be set; this controls the actual types of
    controls and dialogs that are created when a control or dialog creates one
    (e.g. when FileDlg encounters an error and creates a ThreeButtonDlg).
    This is overridden by any StyleFactory that may be installed in an
    individual Wnd.

    <p>A note about "button-down-repeat".  When you click on the down-button
    on a scroll-bar, you probably expect the the button's action (scrolling
    down one increment) to repeat when you hold down the button, much like the
    way kestrokes are repeated when you hold down a keyboard key.  This is in
    fact what happens, and it is accomplished by having the scroll and its
    buttons respond to extra LButtonDown events generated by the GUI.  These
    extra messages, occur ButtonDownRepeatDelay() milliseconds after the
    button is first depressed, repeating every ButtonDownRepeatInterval()
    milliseconds thereafter.  Only Wnds created with the REPEAT_BUTTON_DOWN
    flag receive such extra messages.
