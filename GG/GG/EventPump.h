    \section event_pump_main_section General Use

    Events from the application framework (i.e. SDL, DirectInput, etc.) are
    received by an EventPump, and appropriate action is taken.  The default
    action is to call GUI::HandleSystemEvents(), but any action can be taken
    in a EventPump-derived type that overrides operator()().  For example, it
    might be useful to override operator()() with a function that gives all
    GG-relevant events to a GG event-hendler, and gives all other events to a
    system-specific handler, if your GUI-derived class does not already do so.

    \section event_pump_integration_with_app_render_loop Integration With Application Render Loop

    If your application already has a render loop and you want to integrate GG
    into it, create a subclass of EventPumpBase similar to EventPump, but
    which only executes a single loop iteration:

    \verbatim
#include <GG/EventPump.h>

class MyEventPump :
    public GG::EventPumpBase
{
public:
    void operator()()
        { LoopBody(GG::GUI::GetGUI(), State(), true, true); }
};
\endverbatim

    From your application's rendering loop, invoke your event pump once per
    iteration:

    \verbatim
MyEventPump pump;
// ...
while ( ... ) {
    // Application-specific code to grab events from the OS or other
    // lower-level driver layer and pass the GG-relevant ones to GG goes here.
    // See SDLGUI::HandleSystemEvents() for an example.
    pump();
}
\endverbatim */
class GG_API EventPump : public EventPumpBase
{
public:
    virtual ~EventPump() {} ///< virtual dtor

    /** Cycles through event-handling and rendering, calling
        GUI::HandleSystemEvents() and then EventPumpBase::LoopBody(). */
    virtual void operator()();
};

/** \brief An EventPump that terminates when the bool reference \a done
    supplied to the constructor is true.

    \note Modal Wnds use EventPumps to implement their modality. */
class GG_API ModalEventPump : public EventPump
{
public:
    ModalEventPump(const bool& done); ///< Basic ctor.
    virtual void operator()();

protected:
    /** Returns true iff the constructor parameter \a done is true. */
    bool Done() const;

private:
    const bool& m_done;
};

} // namespace GG
