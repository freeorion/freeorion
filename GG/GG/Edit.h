/** \brief This is a single-line edit box control.

    Note that the constructor determines the height of the control based on
    the height of the font used and the value of the constant PIXEL_MARGIN.
    There are two types of signals emitted by an Edit control.  The first is
    EditedSignal; this is emitted every time the contents of the Edit change.
    Sometimes, however, you don't want that.  For instance, say you want to
    keep the value of the text in the Edit to between (numerical values) 100
    and 300.  If the Edit currently reads "200", the user may decide to
    highlight the "2", hit delete, then type a "1".  If updates are immediate,
    you will receive notification that the Edit says "00" (an invalid value),
    when that is just a temporary value you don't care about.  In such
    situations, the other signal, FocusUpdateSignal, should be useful.  It is
    only emitted when the Edit has changed and is losing focus, or one of
    enter or return is pressed.  So you would only receive a single update,
    namely "100", which is a valid number for that control, and you would
    receive it only when it is certain that the user is finished editing the
    text (when the focus changes).  Note that both signals may be used at the
    same time, if desired. */
