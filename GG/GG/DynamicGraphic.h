/** \brief A control that replays images in sequence, forwards or backwards,
    animated or one frame at a time.

    Frames of animation are stored in GG::Textures.  The frames are assumed to
    be laid out in rows from right to left, top to bottom, like text.  The
    location of each frame is calculated by DynamicGraphic; the user just
    needs to lay out the frames in the right order in the Texture(s) and give
    them to DynamicGraphic.  If a Texture is to be used that has "dead space"
    where there are no frames, that space must be at the end of the Texture,
    and the number of frames in the Texture should be supplied when the
    Texture is added.  When laying out the frames in the textures, the user
    can leave a margin between the frames and between the frames and the edge
    of the overall image, to make Texture creation and editing easier.  The
    width of this margin must be supplied to DynamicGraphic's ctor, and is
    constant once set.  The margin applies to the top and left of \a each
    image, so the margins at the right and bottom edges of the texture are
    optional.  The multiple-Texture ctor assumes that all Textures but the
    last are packed with frames; if you need to specify multiple Textures with
    dead space, construct with an empty \a textures parameter and use
    AddFrames().  Note that DynamicGraphic doesn't have "animated" in its
    name; it can replay images at any speed, and moreover it can be used as a
    sort of slideshow, and doesn't necessarily need to be animated at
    all. \note This is a situation in which the "last+1" idiom used throughout
    GG does not apply; when you set the end frame index to N, the last frame
    to be shown will be N, not N - 1. Also, while this control does not need
    to be the same size as the frames replayed within it, the size of the
    frames is taken from the size of the control when it is contructed. */
