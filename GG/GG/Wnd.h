/** \brief This is the basic GG window class.

    <h3>Window Geometry</h3>

    <br>The coordinates of Wnd boundaries are STL-style (as are most
    range-values throughout GG), meaning that LowerRight() denotes the "last +
    1" pixel of a Wnd.  The on-screen representation of a rectangular Wnd
    covers the pixels from UpperLeft() to LowerRight() - Pt(X1, Y1), \a not
    UpperLeft() to LowerRight().  Each Wnd has a client area from
    ClientUpperLeft() to ClientLowerRight().  These two methods are virtual,
    and may return anything the user likes; the default implementation is to
    return UpperLeft() and LowerRight(), respectively, meaning that the client
    area is the entire window.

    <h3>Child Windows</h3>

    <br>It is assumed that child windows exists within the boundaries of their
    parents, although this is not required.  By default, Wnds do not clip
    their children; child clipping can be turned on or off using
    SetChildClippingMode(), which clips all children to the client and/or
    non-client areas of the Wnd.  Subclasses can override BeginClippingImpl(),
    EndClippingImpl(), BeginNonclientClippingImpl(), and
    EndNonclientClippingImpl() if the clipping should be done using techniques
    other than scissor clipping and stencil testing, or if the Wnd is
    nonrectangular.  Regardless of clipping, all clicks that land on a child
    but outside of the parent will not reach the child, since clicks are
    detected by seaching the top-level Wnds and then searching the children
    within the ones that are hit.  Ideally, "sibling" child windows should not
    overlap (unless they can without interfering).  If this is impossible or
    undesirable, and control is needed over the order in which children are
    layered, MoveChildUp() and MoveChildDown() provide such control.

    <h3>Effects of Window-Creation Flags</h3>

    <br>Resizable() windows are able to be stretched by the user by dragging
    the areas of the window outside the client area.  So the RESIZABLE flag
    will have no effect on a window that does not have non-default
    ClientUpperLeft() and/or ClientLowerRight().  The WindowRegion() method
    can also be overidden in derived classes, and can return regions that are
    appropriate to nonrectangular windows, or those whose client area must
    cover the entire window.

    <br>OnTop() windows are drawn after all others (except Modal() ones), to
    ensure that they remain on top.  This means that other non-OnTop() windows
    that are moved to the top of the z-order stop at some z-value below the
    lowest OnTop() window in the z-order.  On-topness is useful for modeless
    dialog boxes, among other things.

    <br>Modal() windows are available (by setting the MODAL window creation
    flag), and are also always-on-top, but are handled differently and do not
    have ONTOP specified in their creation flags.  Modal windows are executed
    by calling Run(), which registers them as modal windows and starts the
    local execution of the GUI's event pump.  Execution of the code that calls
    Run() is effectively halted until Run() returns.  Derived classes that
    wish to use modal execution should set m_done = true to escape from the
    modal execution loop.  EventPump has more information about processing
    during modal dialog execution.

    <br>Note that OnTop() and Modal() flags only apply to top-level
    (Parent()-less) Wnds.

    <h3>Signal Considerations</h3>

    <br>Wnd inherits from boost::signals2::trackable.  This means that any
    slots contained in a Wnd object or Wnd-derived object will automatically
    be disconnected from any connected signals when the Wnd is destroyed.
    Every Wnd responds to input as driven by the singleton GUI object.

    <h3>Event Filters</h3>

    <br>Every Wnd can also have its incoming WndEvents filtered by an
    arbitrary number of other Wnds.  Each such Wnd in a Wnd's "filter chain"
    gets an opportunity, one at a time, to process an incoming WndEvent, or
    pass it on to the next filter in the chain.  If all EventFilter() calls in
    the chain return false, the filtered Wnd then gets the chance to process
    the WndEvent as normal.  Filter Wnds are traversed in reverse order that
    they are installed, and no filter Wnd can be in a filter chain more than
    once.  Installing the same filter Wnd more than once removes the Wnd from
    the filter chain and re-adds it to the beginning of the chain.  Note that
    the default implementation of EventFilter() is to return false and do
    nothing else, so installing a Wnd-derived type with no overridden
    EventFilter() in a filter Wnd will have no effect.  Also note that just as
    it is legal for keyboard accelerator slots to do nontrivial work and still
    return false (causing a keystroke event to be generated), EventFilter()
    may return false even when it does nontrivial work, and the next filter in
    the chain will also get a chance to process the WndEvent.  It is even
    possible to have an arbitrary number of filters that all do processing on
    an WndEvent, and finally let the filtered Wnd do its normal WndEvent
    processing.

    <h3>Layouts</h3>

    <br>Layouts arrange children in the client area of a window, and can be
    assigned to a window in 4 ways.  HorizontalLayout(), VerticalLayout(), and
    GridLayout() all arrange the window's client-area children automatically,
    and take ownership of them as their own children, becoming the window's
    only client-area child.  Any existing layout is removed first.
    SetLayout() allows you to attach a pre-configured Layout object directly,
    without automatically arranging the window's client-area children.
    Because SetLayout() does no auto-arrangement, it does not know how to
    place any client-area children the window may have at the time it is
    called; for this reason, it not only removes any previous layout, but
    deletes all current client-area children as well.  Therefore, SetLayout()
    should usually only be called before any client-area children are attached
    to a window; all client-area children should be attached directly to the
    layout.  <br>When a window has an attached layout and is resized, it
    resizes its layout automatically.  Further, if a window is part of a
    layout, it notifies its containing layout whenever it is moved, resized,
    or has its MinSize() changed.  This ensures that layouts are always
    current.  Note the use of the phrase "client-area children".  This refers
    to children entirely within the client area of the window.

    <h3>Frame Timing</h3>

    <br>Each frame is a cycle culminating in rendering the screen.  The
    following things happen, in order:
      + events from the GUI and the data sources are handled
      + PreRender() is called to update layout if required.
      + Render() is called.

    Wnd does not distinguish between events from the GUI and events from the
    data sources.

    PreRender() and Render() are only called if the window is visible.

    PreRender() defers all layout changes until after all events have been
    handled.  This improves performance by preventing event handling causing
    multiple layout actions between calls to Render().  PreRender() allows Wnd
    to perform any required expensive updates only once per frame.

    PreRender() prevents bugs caused by early events in a frame changing the
    layout so that later events trigger on a layout different from the layout
    visible to the player.  This is a change from the original GG behavior.
    Core parts of GG will continue to immediately update layout until
    peripheral parts are updated to expect deferred updates.

    The default implementation of PreRender() only clears the flag set by RequirePreRender().
    For a class to defer its layout to the prerender phase it needs to override PreRender() and
    implement its layout changes in PreRender().

    Legacy GG did not have a prerender phase and all layout changes were immediate.  Any Wnd class
    that does not override PreRender() will update layout immediately when executing mutating functions.

    <h3>Browse Info</h3>

    <br>Browse info is a non-interactive informational window that pops up
    after the user keeps the mouse over the Wnd for a certain period of time.
    This can reproduce "tooltip"-like functionality, but is not limited to
    displaying only text.  An arbitrary BrowseInfoWnd-derived window can be
    displayed.  There can be multiple browse info modes, numbered 0 through
    N - 1.  Each mode has a time associated with it, and after the associated
    time has elapsed, that mode is entered.  This is intended to allow
    different levels of detail to be shown for different lengths of mouse
    presence.  For instance, hovering over a Wnd for 1 second might produce a
    box that says "FooWnd", but leaving it there a total of 2 seconds might
    produce a box that says "FooWnd: currently doing nothing".  When the mouse
    leaves the Wnd, a click occurs, etc., the Wnd reverts to browse mode -1,
    indicating that no browse info should be displayed.  By default, every Wnd
    has a single browse info mode at time DefaultBrowseTime(), using the
    DefaultBrowseInfoWnd(), with no associated text.  Note that
    DefaultBrowseInfoWnd() returns a null window unless it is set by the user.
    As this implies, it is legal to have no BrowseInfoWnd associated with a
    browse mode, in which case nothing is shown.  Also note that it is legal
    to have no text associated with a browse mode. \see BrowseInfoWnd

    <h3>Style Factory</h3>

    <br>A StyleFactory is responsible for creating controls and dialogs that
    other Wnds may need (e.g. when Slider needs to create a Button for its
    sliding tab).  There is an GUI-wide StyleFactory available, but for
    complete customization, each Wnd may have one installed as well.  The
    GetStyleFactory() method returns the one installed in the Wnd, if one
    exists, or the GUI-wide one otherwise. */
