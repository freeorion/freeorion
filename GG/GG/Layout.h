/** \brief An invisible Wnd subclass that arranges its child Wnds.

    A Layout consists of a grid of cells.  A cell may have at most one Wnd
    covering it, but need not contain a Wnd at all.  A Wnd may cover any
    rectangular region of cells, though they will commonly only cover one.
    The cells are arranged into rows and columns.  Most attributes of the
    layout are set for an entire row or column, but alignment is set for each
    child in the layout separately.  Rows and columns have two attributes:
    "stretch", and "min" (minimum row width/minimum column height).  Stretch
    indicates a propotional factor by which each row/column is stretched when
    the layout is resized.  For example, if the sum of the row stretch factors
    is 5, a row with a stretch of 2 will gain 2/5 of the increased space if
    the layout grows vertically, or lose 2/5 of the decreased space if the
    layout shrinks vertically.  Note that this means that rows with a stretch
    of 0 will not change size at all.  The exception to this is when all rows
    have a stretch of 0, in which case all the rows grow and shrink evenly.
    Obviously, this applies to columns as well.  The min sets a lower bound on
    the height of a row or the width of a column.  By default, no alignment
    value is set for a child in the layout.  If one is set, the child is not
    grown and shrunk when the layout is resized, if this is possible. Aligned
    children just sit there in the place they are aligned to.  If the layout
    becomes too small, aligned windows will be shrunk as necessary and if
    possible.  Note that the MinSize() and MaxSize() of a child will affect
    how much it can be stretched when the layout is resized.

    <p>Layouts are best used to arrange the children of another window, such
    as arranging the controls of a dialog box.  When used this way, the Layout
    becomes the sole child of its parent, and contains the parent's children
    as its own.  This scheme allows Layouts to be easily nested, since all
    Layouts are Wnd-derived.  Like a Control, a Layout will forward all
    MouseWheel(), Key*(), and dragged-child notification calls to its parent.
    Clicks fall through as well, since Layouts are not constructed with the
    Wnd::INTERACTIVE flag.

    <p>There are two attributes that affect the spacing of all the layout's
    child windows: border margin and cell margin.  Border margin is the space
    left around the entire layout, between the outer edges of the children in
    the layout and the layout's outer edges.  Cell margin is the space left
    between individual Wnds in the layout, but does not add to the margin
    around the outside of the layout.

    <p>A note about how layout minimum sizes are determined: <br>The border
    margin adds to the minimum size of the layout.  Further, the cell margin
    will have an effect on the minimum size of a cell, even an empty one, if
    it is \a greater than the row or column minimum for that cell.  So an
    empty layout with 5 columns, a border margin of 3, and a cell margin of 2
    will have a minumum width of 14.  This is determined as follows: 5 columns
    means 4 cell margins between the columns, so 4 * 2 = 8.  The border margin
    is added to both sides, which means the total minimum width is 8 + 2 * 3 =
    14.  Also, the minimum size of each child in the layout will affect the
    minimum sizes of the rows and columns it covers.  If a child covers more
    than one row/column, its minimum size is distributed over the rows/columns
    it covers, proportional to the stretch factor for each row/column.
    Finally, the min values and stretch factors must both be satisfied
    simultaneously.  For example, if the row mins are set to be [1 2 3] and
    the row stretch factors are set to be [1 2 3], the minimum width will be 6
    (neglecting the margins).  However, if the mins were instead set to be [4
    2 3], the stretch factors would lead to effective minimums of [4 8 12] to
    maintain proportionality, making the minimum width 24.

    \see The Wnd documentation has further information about layouts attached
    to Wnds.
