### Milestones

Important milestones for the release.  Changes will be announced by the release
manager.

<!--
Add all relevant milestones ordered by date or sequence.  Use the YYYY-mm-dd
format for the date.  When a milestone entry is postponed copy the whole entry
and add it below the original entry.  Use ~~ to strike out the date in the
original entry and add a **POSTPONED** in front of the original milestone.

The time references used are mere suggestions.  'SP' stands for starting point,
the first milestone of the release.  '+1W', '+2W' should be interpreted as
'one week after SP', 'two weeks after SP' and so on.
