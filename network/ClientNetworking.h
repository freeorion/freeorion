/** Encapsulates the networking facilities of the client.  The client must
    execute its networking code in a separate thread from its main processing
    thread, for UI and networking responsiveness, and to process synchronous
    communication with the server.

    Because of this, ClientNetworking operates in two threads: the main
    thread, in which the UI processing operates; the networking thread, which
    is created and terminates when the client is connected to and disconnected
    from the server, respectively.  The entire public interface is safe to
    call from the main thread at all times.  Note that the main thread must
    periodically request the next incoming message; the arrival of incoming
    messages is never explicitly signalled to the main thread.  The same
    applies to unintentional disconnects from the server.  The client must
    periodically check IsConnected().

    The ClientNetworking has three modes of operation.  First, it can discover
    FreeOrion servers on the local network; this is a blocking operation with
    a timeout.  Second, it can send an asynchronous message to the server
    (when connected); this is a non-blocking operation.  Third, it can send a
    synchronous message to the server (when connected) and return the server's
    response; this is a blocking operation.

    Note that the SendSynchronousMessage() does not interrupt the sending or
    receiving of asynchronous messages.  When SendSynchronousMessage() is
    called and the main thread blocks to wait for the response message,
    regular messages are still being sent and received.  Some of these regular
    messages may arrive before the response message, but
    SendSynchronousMessage() will still return the response message first,
    even if it is not at the front of the queue at the time.  This implies
    that some response messages may be handled out of order with respect to
    regular messages, but these are in fact the desired semantics. */
