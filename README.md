# FreeOrion

FreeOrion is a free, Open Source, turn-based space empire and galactic conquest
computer game.

FreeOrion is inspired by the tradition of the Master of Orion games, but does
not try to be a clone or remake of that series or any other game.  It builds
on the classic *4X* (eXplore, eXpand, eXploit and eXterminate) model.

While its modular, Open Source design allows for a significant degree of
customization of the game engine and the story elements by the community, the
FreeOrion project is dedicated to the construction of a living, breathing
universe in a *grand campaign* model.


## Requirements

FreeOrion requires an *OpenGL 2.1* capable graphic card and a display with a
minimum resolution of at least *800x600*.

FreeOrion requires at least *Windows XP* with *Service Pack 2* or later,
*Mac OSX 10.7* or later or any reasonably recent Linux distribution on x86
compatible processors.  Other operating systems and architectures have reported
to be working by users, but are not actively supported by the FreeOrion project.


## Download

[FreeOrion Stable Releases] are the recommend way to play FreeOrion.  Stable
Releases can be obtained as native installer binaries for Windows and Mac OSX
or as source releases for Linux and other UNIX-ish platforms from GitHub.

Also some Linux distributions like Fedora, Debian and Arch do provide packages
of FreeOrion.

[FreeOrion Weekly Releases] are in-development releases intended for enthusiasts
and testers, who want to track or contribute to the development.  Weekly
Releases can be obtained as native installer binaries for Windows and Mac OSX
from Sourceforge.


## Install

For Windows execute the native installer binary and follow the on-screen
instructions of the installer to install FreeOrion.

For Mac OSX, open the downloaded DMG file and copy the contained FreeOrion
application to your system Applications folder by Drag and Drop.

For Linux or other from-source installations in general please refer to the

Various Linux distributions provide the stable release of FreeOrion in
a prebuilt way.  Usually you can install those packages by either using
a graphical package manager and searching for *FreeOrion* or by installing the
packages via the command line.
